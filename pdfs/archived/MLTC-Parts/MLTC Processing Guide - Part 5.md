### Step 16: Process and Review Budgets {#magi-budgets}

• When all information is available to run the budget, update NFOCUS and process for eligibility.

**Running budgets:**
- Start running budgets from the application month forward through the come up month
- When running budgets, the come-up month must be processed
- NFOCUS will take the worker through the needed budgets as long as the worker does not cancel out
  - The worker must run the current and come-up month budgets anytime configurations is changed
  - If a budget is run after cutoff, the next two months must be run
- If Retro months are requested, and information is available to process, run budgets for retro months prior to application month

**Review all budgets for correctness:**

**If budget is correct:**
- Determine eligibility
- View unit size and compare to tax household
- Authorize budget

**If budget is incorrect:**
- Make corrections as needed
- Determine eligibility
- View unit size and compare to tax household authorize budget

• Assure that Program Case name remains FR Adult, if applicable. This will assure that notice is generated to the adult, online AccessNebraska account is available and Heritage Health Enrollment and MCO information is accessible to the FR Adult.

### Step 17: Continuous Eligibility {#magi-continuous-eligibility}

• Review for any approved individuals who may be continuously eligible. CE individuals include:
- Children, pregnant individuals or individuals in their postpartum period, deemed newborns (newborns born to a Medicaid active mother) and 599 CHIP newborns

**Best Practice:** Narrate under the Continuous Eligibility subheading about who is CE and the timeframe of their CE period.

See the [Continuous Eligibility Guide](Continuous%20Eligibility%20Guide.md) for more information.

---

### Step 18: Review Date {#magi-review-date}

• Review date should be set so that the review occurs 12 months from application month.
- **For example:** If an application dated 4/16/2020 is approved, the review should be set for 3/31/2021

---

### Step 19: Notices {#magi-notices}

• Generate and Send Notice of Action. Review this once the case is checked in to assure that appropriate information is displayed on the notice. May need to update comments with specific information that may not be captured.

---

### Step 21: Potential Income {#magi-potential-income}

• Per Medicaid policy, an individual who is receiving Medicaid is required to apply for potential income they may be entitled to within 60 days.

**Potential income may include the following:**
- Unemployment compensation, annuities, pensions, retirement, and disability benefits to which they are entitled
- Use critical thinking to determine if the individual may be eligible for this income

• If determined the individual might be eligible for this income, send a VR to the individual, allowing 60 days for the individual to provide verification that he/she has taken all necessary steps to obtain this income. Update the VR due date to 60 days from the date the VR is created.

---

### Step 22: CHARTS Referral {#magi-charts}

• After processing, determine if a Referral to CSE (CHARTS Referral) needs to be made. See the [Child Support Referral Guide](Child%20Support%20Referral%20Guide.md) for further information on submitting a CHARTS referral.

### Step 23: Voter Registration {#magi-voter-registration}

• Check the application to determine if the individual requested to apply to register to vote. See the [Voter Registration SOP](Voter%20Registration%20SOP%207.2021.md) for further information.

• If the individual requested to register to vote offer link to register on-line:
- https://www.nebraska.gov/apps-sos-voter-registration/ or provide Voter Registration form
- A printable PDF version: https://sos.nebraska.gov/elec/pdf/vr-fillable.pdf

---

### Step 24: Narrate {#magi-narrate}

• Narrate actions taken on the case.

**If case is approved:**
- Narrate through the Approval subject and subheadings

**If case is denied for "Failed to Provide Information":**
- Indicate missing information and Day 90 from the application date

**If the case remains pending past the required timeframes for an eligibility determination:**
- The worker must review the case and document in the narrative the reason a decision is unable to be made

---

### Step 25: Clear Alerts/Work Tasks {#magi-clear-alerts}

• Process and clear any MLTC alerts or work tasks on the case.

---

### Step 26: Case Mode {#magi-case-mode}

• Check for correct case mode:

**Case should be in "Change Management" mode** if processing is complete.

**Case should be in "Processing" mode** if denied for "Failed to Provide Information".

---

### Step 27: Information Provided Within 90 Days of Application on Denied Case {#magi-90-days}

• Determine if it is within the 90 days from the application date. If within 90 days and:

**All information / verifications are present:**
- Re-pend back to application month and process same day

**If still unable to process:**
- Do not re-pend the case
- Send speed note stating what information / verifications are still needed

See [Changes Reported During 90 Day Redetermination Period](Changes%20Reported%20During%2090%20Day%20Redetermination%20Period.md) for further information on the process to take when a new change is reported during the 90 day redetermination period.

• Attempt to contact individual by phone for follow-up if areas on the application are left blank or where clarification is needed. See [Unanswered Questions](Unanswered%20Questions.md) for further information.

• Refer to the [Former Foster Care Guide](Former%20Foster%20Care%20Guide.md) for further information when the application indicates that someone was previously in Foster Care, in any state, and is under age 26.

**Incarcerated Individuals:**

Applications must be accepted and Medicaid eligibility determined for individuals who are residing in a 24 hour facility that are being discharged either the month the application was submitted or the month after the application was submitted. Examples of these facilities include Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Centers, Regional Centers, Department of Corrections facilities, County Jails, and County Youth facilities.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The SUPPORT Act of October 2018 added a provision that applies to applications received for juveniles (defined as individuals under age 21 and individuals who may be eligible under Former Foster Care). The state is required to accept and process applications for individuals up to age 26 at any point during their period of incarceration.

**Universal Staff Duties:**
- For any application received where an individual indicates they are incarcerated, staff must assign the case to the **INC ASSIST position number (66118075)**

**Social Security Low Income Subsidy (LIS) SSA-L Applications:**

The Social Security Administration electronically transmits the data from their application for extra help with Medicare Part D prescription drug plan costs to Nebraska for those individuals who have filed the SSA application and have a Nebraska mailing address.

- **SSA Subsidy Approval** - Result of SSA LIS determination Yes=Award No=Denial
- **SSA LIS Approval/Disapproval Date** - Date SSA made determination of LIS eligibility
- **Subsidy Effective Date** – Effective date of approved subsidy app. If the applicant already has Medicare, this will be the first month of eligibility for extra help with Medicare Part D expenses
- **Subsidy Denial Reason** – The reason SSA denied the LIS application. Applicant may have more than one denial reason:
  - **Not an A/B Medicare Beneficiary** – The applicant wasn't receiving Medicare Part A or B benefits during the LIS process
  - **Failure to Cooperate** – The applicant did not provide the necessary information requested by SSA to determine LIS eligibility
  - **Resources** – The applicant's countable resources exceed LIS guidelines
