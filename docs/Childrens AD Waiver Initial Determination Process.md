Process:
1) Eligibility Operations receives an AD Waiver request
a) When a Medicaid application is received for a child 17 years old or younger, an Eligibility
Operations SSW reviews the Medicaid application to determine if AD Waiver services
are being requested or otherwise are appropriate to consider;
i) If AD Waiver services are not being requested and not otherwise appropriate to
consider, this SOP does not apply. Stop here; or
ii) If AD Waiver services are being requested or otherwise are appropriate to consider,
the case is:
(1) assigned to Child Waiver position number 3213036 by the Eligibility Operations
SSW if not already assigned by an office technician; and
(2) the MLTC supervisor assigned to monitor the position number assigns the case
to a Children’s AD Waiver SSW to handle the AD Waiver services request.
Proceed to Step 2; or
b) If AD Waiver services are requested outside of a Medicaid application for a child 17
years old or younger, the request for AD Waiver services is sent immediately to the
currently designated Eligibility Operations contact so that an Eligibility Operations SSW
can determine if a current Medicaid application is on file:
i) If a Medicaid application is on file, proceed to Step 1(a)(ii); or
ii) If a Medicaid application is not on file, the Eligibility Operations SSW reaches out to
the child’s representative to apply and:
(1) If an application is not received, this SOP does not apply. Stop here; or
(2) If an application is received, the case is:
(a) assigned to Child Waiver position number 3213036 by the Eligibility
Operations SSW; and
(b) the MLTC supervisor assigned to monitor the position number assigns the
case to a Children’s AD Waiver SSW to handle the AD Waiver services
request. Proceed to Step 2.
2) Case is assigned to the AD Waiver SSW
a) The AD Waiver SSW attempts to reach the child’s representative within 2 business days
of the case assignment;
b) If contact is:
i) Made - the AD Waiver SSW:
(1) Explains the Children’s AD Waiver program and the services that it can provide;
(2) Explains the need to have both a current disability determination and currently
meet the NF LOC to be able to participate in the Children’s AD Waiver program;
(3) If the child’s representative wants to proceed with the request for AD Waiver
services, explains the SRT process (if SSA has not approved for current
disability) and that a SRT VR#1 will be arriving in the mail with requests for them
to give to their provider(s);

income sources listed on the application are current and complete. If no

and sends an email to the E&E Unit at dhhs.adwaiverapp@nebraska.gov
informing them that the request has been denied. Stop here; or

(1) Completes the DM-12 with available information and uploads it to DI; and

for Children; and
(2) Medical Documentation Guide for Providers – Disability Review for Children; and,
iii) The following language:
<CHILD’S NAME> may be eligible for Medicaid because of a disability based on their
circumstances.
The enclosed DM-5 form needs to be completed by your child’s medical provider
who knows the most about their disability. This form allows that provider to describe
your child’s disability. Give it to your child’s provider to fill out.
You also need to request records from within the last 12 months that
document and specifically relate to your child’s disability. This could be from
more than one provider if your child sees more than one provider about their
disability. When you contact your provider(s), please be sure to contact any therapy
and mental health providers. Clinic visit summaries from a patient portal cannot be
used. Your child’s providers must send a copy of the actual medical records. If your
child has an individualized education plan (IEP), MDT or IFSP, ask your child’s
school to send a copy.
