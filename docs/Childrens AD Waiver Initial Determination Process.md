## Key Takeaways

✓ **Two-Part Requirement:** Children must meet BOTH disability criteria AND nursing facility LOC standards to be eligible for AD Waiver services.

✓ **Family-Centered Approach:** Representative involvement is essential throughout the process; explain procedures clearly and document all interactions.

✓ **Educational Records Matter:** For school-age children, request IEP or MDT reports; for younger children, request IFSP if available; these are critical for developmental disability assessment.

✓ **Documentation is Critical:** Medical providers must send actual records (not patient portal summaries) within specified timeframes; failure to provide results in application denial.

✓ **30-Day First Request:** SRT VR#1 allows 30 days for medical documentation submission; this is the critical window for file completion.

✓ **21-Day Second Request:** If additional records are needed, SRT VR#2 allows only 21 days for submission; shorter window requires prompt action and clear communication.

✓ **90-Day Application Timeline:** Service Coordination must complete intake and obtain Person-Centered Plan consent by day 89 of application date to meet federal timelines.

✓ **Parental Income Disregard:** Upon AD Waiver approval, Medicaid is processed with disregard of parental income; ensure this is correctly configured in N-FOCUS.

✓ **Multiple Touchpoints:** Process involves coordination between Eligibility Operations, AD Waiver SSW, SRT Clinical Team, SRT MD, E&E Unit, and Service Coordination to ensure comprehensive assessment accounting for child's developmental status.
