**Local Office/CSC Staff**: Can use the consent line to acquire missing consent signatures.

**CSC Staff (Remote/Soft Phone)**: Staff not assigned to application queues or working remotely using a soft phone should use the consent line to capture signatures so that the appropriate records retention schedule is followed.

### What the Consent Line Records

The process consists of:
1. Reading the appropriate script
2. Collecting the electronic signature

### When NOT to Use

**CSC Staff Assigned to Application Queues**: If you are in a CSC and you are assigned to an application queue, you will not need to use the Consent Line (unless using a Soft Phone).
