# Former Foster Care Guide

## Medicaid Eligibility for Youth Aging Out of Foster Care

### Overview

This guide assists in processing Medicaid eligibility for Former Foster Care (FFC) individuals. Effective January 1, 2023, section 1002 of The SUPPORT Act expands Medicaid eligibility for the FFC program to youth who were in foster care in any state. Previously, only youth who were in foster care in Nebraska could be considered for Nebraska Medicaid's FFC program. There is no mandatory requirement to review for eligibility in another Medicaid category prior to approving FFC MED.

## Eligibility Requirements

### Basic FFC Eligibility Criteria

To qualify for Former Foster Care Medicaid, an individual must meet ALL of the following:

1. **Under age 26**
2. **Was a State or Tribal ward in any state** OR was/is enrolled in the Bridge to Independence Program, has signed a voluntary services and support agreement, and is not living with a parent or guardian
3. **Was in foster care anytime at age 18 or 19**, or a higher age at which the state's IV-E assistance ends
4. **Received Medicaid while they were a ward in foster care** at age 18 or 19, or a higher age at which the state's IV-E assistance ends
5. **Meets primary eligibility criteria** such as citizenship and immigration (477 NAC 5-000; Medicaid Citizenship and Immigration Guide)

### What Counts as "Foster Care"

**Placements that ARE considered foster care**:
- Group homes
- Foster family homes
- Residential treatment facilities
- Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities (PRTF)
- Independent Living (IL) arrangements

**Placements that are NOT considered foster care**:
- Detention Centers
- Placed with parents
- Adoption or Guardianships (including subsidized adoption/subsidized guardianship)

**Important**: "On run" is a designation, NOT a placement. The key is the last actual placement.

### Determining Placement at Age 18

A review of the CFS placement window on NFOCUS will need to occur to determine the individual's placement at age 18.

**If the individual was ever in foster care, even for a day, on or after their 18th birthday**, eligibility for FFC shall be reviewed.

### Expanded Eligibility (Effective January 1, 2023)

Individuals who turn 18 years old **on or after January 1, 2023**, were in foster care in any state, enrolled in Medicaid upon turning 18 years old, and meet all other eligibility requirements of the FFC program can have their eligibility for FFC be reviewed. See Policy Memo 23-01 for additional information.

**Important**: This expansion only applies to individuals who turned 18 on or after January 1, 2023.

## FFC Determination Process

### Initial Review

When an individual answers yes to the Foster Care question on the healthcare application:

1. **Case Assignment**: The case is assigned to the FFC position number: 65545158

2. **Worker Review**: The assigned worker will review the individual's eligibility for FFC

### Step-by-Step Eligibility Review

#### Question 1: Is the individual under the age of 26?
- **If NO**: The individual is not FFC eligible

#### Question 2: Was the individual a State or Tribal ward in any state?
OR was/is the individual enrolled in the Bridge to Independence Program, has signed a voluntary services and support agreement, and is not living with a parent or guardian?
- **If NO**: The individual is not FFC eligible
- **If YES, and they were in foster care in Nebraska**: Follow step 3

#### Question 3: Was the individual in foster care anytime at age 18 or 19, or a higher age at which the state's IV-E assistance ends?
- Review the CFS placement window on NFOCUS to determine the individual's placement at age 18
- If the individual was ever in foster care, even for a day, on or after their 18th birthday, eligibility for FFC shall be reviewed
- Note: Specific placements are not considered "foster care" (Detention Centers, Placed with parents, Adoption or Guardianships)

#### Question 4: Did the individual receive Medicaid while they were a ward in foster care at age 18 or 19, or a higher age at which the state's IV-E assistance ends?
- **If NO**: The individual is not FFC eligible

#### Question 5: Is the individual already enrolled in another Medicaid category?
- If the individual is enrolled in another category (PW, PCR, Children's MED, AABD, etc.), the individual will remain in that category unless he or she becomes ineligible
- If the individual loses eligibility in the current category, eligibility under FFC will be reviewed

#### Question 6: Does the individual meet primary eligibility criteria?
FFC individuals must still meet primary eligibility criteria such as citizenship and immigration. See 477 NAC 5-000 and Medicaid Citizenship and Immigration Guide.

### Case Examples

#### Example 1: Out-of-State Foster Care (Post-2023)
- **Application submitted**: 3/1/2023
- **Current age**: 18 years old (birthday was 1/25/2023)
- **Foster care state**: California
- **Status**: Medicaid eligible and in foster care in California on 18th birthday

**Result**: Because the individual was a ward of the State of California, Medicaid eligible, and in foster care on their 18th birthday, their eligibility for FFC can be reviewed.

**Note**: Individuals who turn 18 years old on or after January 1, 2023, were in foster care in any state, enrolled in Medicaid upon turning 18 years old, and meet all other eligibility requirements of the FFC program can have their eligibility for FFC be reviewed.

#### Example 2: Out-of-State Foster Care (Pre-2023)
- **Application submitted**: 3/1/2023
- **Current age**: 24 years old
- **Foster care state**: California
- **18th birthday**: Prior to January 1, 2023

**Result**: The individual cannot be reviewed because they turned age 18 prior to January 1st, 2023.

#### Example 3: "On Run" Status
- **Application submitted**: 10/2019
- **Current age**: 22 years old
- **Foster care state**: Nebraska
- **Placement at age 18**: Group home
- **Status before age 19**: "On run"

**Result**: Being "on run" is a designation, NOT a placement. The key is the last placement, which was "group home". Because the individual received Medicaid at the time they were a ward of the state and in foster care while age 18, their eligibility for FFC can be reviewed.

#### Example 4: Immigration 5-Year Bar
- **Application submitted**: 7/2019
- **Current age**: 20 years old
- **Foster care state**: Nebraska
- **Placement while age 18**: Group home with Medicaid
- **Immigration status**: Lawfully residing immigrant, in U.S. for 4 years only
- **Previous status**: Exempt from 5-year bar as a child

**Result**: As an adult, the individual is no longer exempt from the 5-year bar. Citizenship and Immigration regulations are applied and the individual is not Medicaid eligible as they do not meet the 5-year bar.

#### Example 5: Pregnant Woman with FFC Eligibility
- **Application submitted**: 11/2019
- **Current age**: 23 years old, pregnant
- **Foster care state**: Nebraska
- **Placement while age 17-18**: Group home, released at 18¾ years old
- **Income**: $2,000 per month (earned)

**Result**: The individual is income eligible for the Pregnant Woman's category, but to eliminate barriers in getting enrolled in coverage (i.e., verifying the income), the individual can be placed in FFC.

**Note**: After the continuous eligibility period ends, the individual is placed in FFC if they are over income for Parent/Caretaker Relative.

#### Example 6: PRTF Placement in Another State
- **Application submitted**: 11/2019
- **Current age**: 20 years old
- **Foster care state reported**: Iowa
- **Actual status**: Ward of Nebraska, placed in PRTF in Iowa
- **Placement age**: Age 17 in PRTF, released at 19 years old

**Result**: Because the individual was a ward of the State of Nebraska and in foster care, their eligibility for FFC can be reviewed.

#### Example 7: Juvenile Probation (Not Eligible)
- **Application submitted**: 12/2019
- **Current age**: 20 years old
- **Foster care state**: Nebraska
- **CFS records**: No record of Nebraska wardship
- **Actual status**: Office of Juvenile Probation placed in group home until age 19

**Result**: In this case the individual was NOT a ward of the State of Nebraska. They were under court supervision, and are not eligible for FFC.

#### Example 8: Independent Living Before Age 18
- **Application submitted**: 10/2019
- **Current age**: 21 years old
- **Foster care state**: Nebraska
- **Placement status at age 18**: Independent Living
- **Placement timeline**: Age 17 and 11 months through age 19 in IL

**Result**: The individual IS FFC eligible as they were in Independent Living before they turned 18.

#### Example 9: Group Home Then Independent Living
- **Application submitted**: 10/2019
- **Current age**: 21 years old
- **Foster care state**: Nebraska
- **Placement at age 17-18**: Group home from age 17 and 11 months through age 18 and 2 days
- **Then transitioned**: To IL at 18 and 2 days old

**Result**: The individual IS FFC eligible as they were in foster care at age 18.

## FFC Renewal Process

### Step 1: Desk Renewal

An alert/WT will be generated by NFOCUS when the desk review is due.

**SSW Actions**:
1. Review information present on the case for leads that the client may no longer be a Nebraska resident
   - Recent applications
   - Document imaging
   - Other case information

2. Review the individual's non-citizen status to determine whether updated alien status verification is needed

3. If the SSW is able to reasonably determine:
   - Client remains a NE resident
   - Is under the age of 26
   - Continues to have an eligible immigration status

**Result**: The FFC budget will be run and the desk renewal will be narrated and completed.

**Note**: The SSW can assume there is no change in residency or alien status unless the client reports a change or a lead is found on the case.

### Step 2: Phone Call

If the SSW discovers a lead that the client may no longer be a NE resident or needs to collect updated alien verification:

1. The SSW will attempt a call out to the client to obtain the needed information
2. The call out must be documented on NFOCUS
3. If the SSW contacts the client and is able to obtain the needed information, the FFC budget will be run and the desk review will be narrated and completed

### Step 3: FFC Renewal Form

If the SSW is unable to contact the client:

1. The SSW will send the FFC renewal form from correspondence
2. If the form is returned, the SSW will review the form and determine eligibility for FFC
3. If the SSW is able to complete the renewal, the FFC budget will be run and the desk review will be narrated and completed
4. If the form is not returned, the case will be closed for "Failure to complete renewal"

**Important**: Ensure that the attempts for steps 1 and 2 are documented in NFOCUS before moving to step 3.

### Returned Mail Process

If there is returned mail on an FFC case, refer to the Returned Mail Process.

### Scenario 3: Case Closed for Other Eligibility Requirements (IL Issue)

If the individual was open (e.g., PCR) and subsequently closed because they no longer met eligibility requirements and were determined not FFC eligible, due to the IL living arrangement:

**Action**: Open the FFC MED for the month they were closed for.

**Renewal date**:
