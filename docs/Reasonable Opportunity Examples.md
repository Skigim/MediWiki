## Key Definitions

**Reasonable Opportunity Period:** A 90-day timeframe given for documentation to be provided regarding citizenship or immigration status. Benefits must not be denied, delayed, reduced, or terminated during this period.

**VSTAT:** Vital Statistics - an electronic system for verifying birth records.

**VLP:** Verify Lawful Presence - an electronic system for verifying immigration status through the Department of Homeland Security.

**Notice Date:** The date printed on the Notice of Action. The reasonable opportunity period begins 5 days after this date (allowing time for mail delivery), unless the individual shows they did not receive the notice within the five-day period.

## Example 1: Children with Unverified Citizenship

### Question

Susan Smith applied for Medicaid for her three children, Jane, Jeff, and John (all under age 19). Susan attested on the application that all three children are United States Citizens. Jane was born in Iowa and the other two children, Jeff and John were born in Nebraska. Citizenship was verified via VSTAT for Jeff and John. Susan was contacted and she stated that she didn't have a copy of Jane's birth certificate on hand. 

**Should Jane receive the reasonable opportunity period?**

### Answer

**Yes**, a 90-day timeframe is given for documentation to be provided regarding Jane's citizenship since Susan declared she is a United States Citizen. 

**Process:**
1. If Jane meets all other eligibility factors, **approve Medicaid**
2. Send a notice informing Susan of the reasonable opportunity period

**Calculating the 90-Day Period:**
- The reasonable opportunity period extends 90 days from the date on which the notice is **received** by the individual
- This means five days after the date of notice unless Susan shows she did not receive the notice within the five day period

**Example Calculation:**
- Notice is mailed: 7/1/14
- Notice received (assumed): 7/6/14
- Susan has 90 days from 7/6/14 to provide the citizenship verification

## Example 2: Pregnant Woman with Qualified Alien Status

### Question

Alexis Frank submitted a Medicaid application as she is pregnant. She declared that she is not a U.S. Citizen, she is married to a U.S. Citizen, has a work permit, and has provided her seven digit document ID number. Alexis attested that she is a qualified alien. VLP was not able to verify her alien status and copies of her immigration documents have been requested. 

**Should Alexis receive the reasonable opportunity period?**

### Answer

**Yes**, a 90-day timeframe is given for documentation to be provided regarding Alexis' alien status.

**Process:**
1. Since Alexis declared she was not a U.S. Citizen and was a qualified alien, process her as a **lawfully present pregnant woman** if she meets all other eligibility factors
2. Inform Alexis on the notice of the reasonable opportunity period

**Calculating the 90-Day Period:**
- The reasonable opportunity period extends 90 days from the date on which the notice is **received** by the individual
- This means five days after the date of notice unless Alexis shows she did not receive the notice within the five day period

**Example Calculation:**
- Notice is mailed: 7/1/14
- Notice received (assumed): 7/6/14
- Alexis has 90 days from 7/6/14 to provide the citizenship verification

**Regulatory Reference:** See 477 NAC 5-006
