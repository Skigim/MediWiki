# MLTC Citizenship and Immigration Guide

**Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services | Medicaid & Long-Term Care**

## Overview

Under federal law, states are required to verify the citizenship and immigration status of applicants for Medicaid. This guide provides workers with a comprehensive tool to help with information collection, reduce review time, and limit errors. It addresses eligibility criteria, verification processes, reasonable opportunity periods, and specific immigration statuses. The guide aims to reduce the number of cases requiring Central Office review while ensuring accurate determinations.

## Key Definitions

**Reasonable Opportunity Period:** A 90-day timeframe allowing individuals to verify citizenship or immigration status while not holding up eligibility determination. Benefits cannot be denied, left pending, or terminated while awaiting verification (no policy approval required).

**Class of Admission (COA):** The immigrant category used to admit someone into the U.S. as a permanent resident or conditional permanent resident. Found under "category" on the front of a green card, typically one or two letters followed by a number (e.g., IR2).

**Five Year Bar:** A 5-year waiting period many qualified non-citizens (such as LPRs) must wait after receiving qualified immigration status before receiving Medicaid or CHIP coverage. Exceptions include COFA migrants, Ukrainian humanitarian parolees, Iraqi and Afghan special immigrants, refugees, asylees, and LPRs who used to be refugees or asylees. Nebraska waived the five-year bar for pregnant women and children.

**Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR):** Individuals legally accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the United States. These individuals have a "green card" with an expiration ten years after issuance. They must reapply for a new LPR card at expiration or apply for citizenship.

**Lawfully Present:** Individuals who have a qualified non-citizen immigration status. This term applies to anyone in the United States legally but is not a citizen, including LPRs, refugees, asylees, or those with employment authorization, student visas, or visitor visas.

**Provision of Law:** The law in which an individual is admitted into the United States. The COA may reflect the particular provision of law that describes a non-citizen's immigration status.

**Sponsor:** An individual who is a citizen or national of the United States (or lawfully admitted alien for permanent residence), at least 18 years of age, lives in any state or District of Columbia, and is the person petitioning for the admission of the alien under Section 204 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. An organization cannot be a sponsor.

**U.S. Citizen:** Someone who was born in the United States (including U.S. territories except American Samoa) or who was born outside the U.S. and was naturalized, derived citizenship through parent(s) naturalization, derived citizenship through adoption by U.S. citizen parents, acquired citizenship at birth through U.S. citizen parent(s), or became a U.S. citizen by operation of law.

**Disclosure of Immigration Status:** State Medicaid and CHIP agencies cannot require applicants to provide information about the citizenship or immigration status of any family or household members who are not applying for coverage. Benefits cannot be denied because an applicant's family or household member who is not applying has not disclosed their citizenship or immigration status.

## Reasonable Opportunity Period

### Overview

Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), individuals who meet all eligibility requirements and declare to be a U.S. citizen or qualified non-citizen must have their eligibility processed while verification of their citizenship or immigration status is pending.

### Key Requirements

✓ **Benefits cannot be denied, left pending, or terminated while awaiting verification** - Does NOT require policy approval

✓ **Use when:** No electronic data sources available, VLP/SAVE steps 2 or 3 are being initiated, paper verifications are being requested, or the individual has no paper documentation immediately available

✓ **Allowed once per eligibility period** - Encompasses all aspects of the process to verify citizenship or immigration status

✓ **New RO period required when:** Individual applies and has been closed for more than 90 days, or if there is an attested change in immigration status

✓ **Extension requests:** Must be sent to the Policy mailbox at DHHS.MedicaidPolicyQuestions@Nebraska.gov

### Reasonable Opportunity Process

**Step 1: Provide 90-Day Notice**
- 90-day timeframe given to verify attested citizenship or non-citizen status
- The Department must provide notice of the RO period
- The 90-day clock begins the date the individual receives the Notice of Action (NOA), generally 5 days after the "Notice Date"

**Required Notice Language:**
```
Citizenship or non-citizen status has not been verified for (NAME). A 90-day reasonable 
opportunity period (477 NAC 5-006) has been applied for the Department to conclude the 
electronic verification process and/or the applicant to provide the satisfactory citizenship 
or immigration documents. Retroactive Medicaid cannot be authorized during the reasonable 
opportunity period (42 CFR 435.956(a)(5)(iii)). If citizenship or non-citizen status has 
not been verified by (DATE; use the calculator on MERL), Medicaid benefits will be terminated.
```

**Step 2: Create Manual Alert**
- Set alert for the end of the reasonable opportunity period to review that citizenship or immigration status has been verified and all inconsistencies resolved
- Alert must be set for **95 days from the notice date**

**Step 3: Request Additional Information if Needed**
- If additional information is needed, send a VR
- VR due date must mirror the time allowed for the reasonable opportunity period
- A request for information should NOT be included on the NOA

**Important Notes:**
- Retroactive Medicaid cannot be authorized during the reasonable opportunity period
- If VLP response won't allow NFOCUS budgets to be processed, follow the VLP SAVE Workaround Process
- See "Reasonable Opportunity Period" and "Reasonable Opportunity Examples" documents on MERL for further information

## Common Immigration Statuses

### U.S. Citizens and Nationals

Anyone who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. national meets the citizenship criteria for eligibility.

### Lawfully Present / Qualified Aliens

- Immigrants who are in the U.S. legally
- Must meet all other requirements such as residency and income
- Must be reviewed for the 5-year bar
- List of immigrants exempt from the five-year bar available via A2 of the 5-Year Bar Q&A Policy Log on SharePoint

### COFA Migrants

As of December 27, 2020, citizens of Palau, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia living in the United States through treaties known as the Compacts of Free Association (COFA) are considered qualified non-citizens and are exempt from the five-year bar.

**Special Note:** This change does not affect the definition of lawfully present under section 214 of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA). Therefore, individuals with a COFA immigration status who are pregnant or under age 19 continue to be reviewed under lawfully present.

### Iraqi and Afghan Special Immigrants

- Individuals with a special immigrant status are considered qualified non-citizens from the date they were granted a special immigrant status
- Exempt from the five-year bar
- As part of Operation Allies Refuge, this status is expanded for Afghan evacuees, who may qualify as:
  - Special Immigrant LPR
  - Special Immigrant parolee
  - Special Immigrant Conditional LPR
- **Afghan humanitarian parolees** admitted under section 212(d) of the INA with a status grant date of July 31, 2021, or later, with COA of DT, PAR, and OAR are exempt from the five-year bar through March 31, 2023, or the term of the parole, whichever is later

### Refugees

**Refugee Resettlement Program (RRP) Eligibility:**

During their first months in the U.S., refugees may be eligible for assistance through the Refugee Resettlement Program (RRP), managed by the Office of Economic Assistance (OEA). Individuals may be eligible for Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA) through the RRP program if found ineligible for Medicaid:

- **Entry date before 5/5/2025:** If individual has existing Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA) with an eligibility date before 5/5/2025, they may be eligible for RRP benefits during their first **12 months** in the U.S. from entry date
- **Entry date 5/5/2025 or later:** They may be eligible for RRP benefits during their first **4 months** in the U.S. from entry date

**Important Note:** Individuals found eligible for RRP benefits on or after 5/5/2025 will be eligible for 4 months of benefits. Individuals with existing eligibility may receive up to 12 months of RRP benefits.

**After RRP Assistance:**
- Once a refugee has received their final months of RRP assistance, the Immigration Status in Expert must be updated from "Refugee" to "Refugee –Section 207" or their current immigration status
- OEA will no longer manage the case and MLTC will take over management of the Medicaid case
- The "Immigration Status Date" and "U.S. Entry Date" do not need to be updated
- Refugees who are Medicaid eligible are processed by assigned staff - Follow the Refugee Process guide

### Victims of a Severe Form of Trafficking

Trafficking victims may be eligible for a T visa or Continued Presence (CP) from USCIS, though the average processing time for a T visa approval is 18.5 months after the application is submitted.

**With T Visa or CP Status:**
- If the applicant has a T visa or CP status, VLP must be used to verify status

**Without T Visa or Continued Presence:**
- Trafficking victim may present either a certification letter (for adults) or an eligibility letter (for children)
- These letters are issued by the Office of Refugee Resettlement
- **Do NOT submit these letters to VLP**
- Instead, contact the **Trafficking Victim Verification Line (1-866-401-5510)** to verify the validity of the letter
- The letter, along with this phone verification, are considered proof of status and no other verification is required
- The date within the body of the letter is the status effective date

### Visas

- Immigrants who have a valid visa (not expired) are lawfully present and meet immigration requirements
- Must meet all other requirements such as residency and income (refer to the Nebraska Residency Guide)
- **B visa holders (visitors) will be reviewed by central office:**
  - Contact the individual to obtain additional information using the Visa Supplemental Questions Tool prior to submitting to CO
  - For policy review, submit the email to the policy questions mailbox, include the individual's intent to remain and any other pertinent case information gathered when discussing residency

### Pending vs. Approved Status

**Important Distinction:** There is a difference between pending applicants for asylum, parolee, etc. and those that have an approved status.

- **Pending applicants** for asylum, parolee, etc. would only meet eligibility requirements if they are a pregnant woman or a child under age 19
- **All other individuals** must have an approved status

### Children Under Age 19 and Pregnant Women Who Are Lawfully Present

- Exempt from the five-year bar
- Must meet all other requirements such as residency and income
- **No longer require Central Office approval**
- **Lawfully present pregnant women and children no longer require Central Office review**

### Individuals Turning Age 19 and Women at End of Postpartum Period

When individuals who are lawfully present turn age 19, or women reach the end of their postpartum period:

- They are no longer exempt from the five-year bar or considered lawfully present
- Citizenship and immigration status for these individuals must be re-verified following the "Verification via the Federal Data Services Hub" section

- The DACA code of admission is **C33** on the employment authorization card
- VLP may show a code of **EWI** which is usually an indicator of DACA

**Undocumented / Illegal Immigrant:**
- An undocumented, or illegal, alien is a non-qualified immigrant

**Invalid Status:**
- Individuals who may have been lawfully present, but no longer are, would be a non-qualified immigrant

## Verification Process

### Verification via the Federal Data Services Hub

The Federal Data Services Hub, which includes Social Security and SAVE interfaces (e.g., SSA and VLP), is the primary source for citizenship and immigration verification.

**To determine if citizenship has previously been verified by the Hub, review:**
- SSA Interface
- VLP Interface
- Person Detail – Verifications
- Expert System – Verifications

For additional information regarding VLP steps see the **Verify Lawful Presence (VLP) Agency Action Field** document.

### Verification Process for U.S. Citizens and U.S. Nationals

If citizenship or immigration has not been verified, attempt verification via the "US Citizenship and Immigration" window (accessed from the Actions Menu of the Detail Master Case window):

1. Select the person from the Medicaid person list
2. Select the **Attested US Citizen** radio button
3. The 'Determine As of Date' will default to the current date (change if necessary)
4. Click the **Submit for Verification** button

A citizenship verification request will be sent to SSA through the Hub. Verification should be received within about 10 minutes and will be visible via the SSA interface.

### Verification Process for Documented Non-Citizens

1. Select the person from the Medicaid person list
2. Select the **Documented Non-US Citizen** radio button
3. The 'Determine As of Date' will default to the current date (change it if necessary)
4. Select the Document Type that matches the document provided by the individual or indicated on the application form
5. Enter the document numbers and the country that match the information provided on the document(s) or indicated on the application form
6. Click the **"Submit to DHS/SAVE Interface"** button
7. An immigration verification request will be sent to DHS/SAVE through the Hub

Verification should be received within about 10 minutes and will be visible via the VLP Interface. If verification via the Federal Data Services Hub is unsuccessful, the worker may get a request to institute additional verification.

### Verification Process if the Federal Data Services Hub is Unsuccessful

**NOTE:** At this time, the Hub may not be correctly verifying the immigration status for individuals with a COFA status. See the Compacts of Free Association (COFA) Policy Memo 21-04 for additional guidance.

**Other Electronic Data Sources:**

Electronic sources must be used prior to requesting paper verification. These may include:
- VSTAT
- SAVE - If SAVE is utilized, copies of the SAVE responses must be uploaded to Document Imaging (DI)
- SVES

**Paper Verification:**

Paper verification sources may be requested if there are no available electronic data sources. Once immigration documents are received, the paper verification must then be used to submit a request in VLP to verify electronically.

Acceptable paper verification documents include (a detailed description of each can be found online at uscis.gov):
- Permanent Resident Card, "Green Card" (I-551)
- Reentry Permit (I-327)
- Refugee Travel Document (I-571)
- Employment Authorization Card (I-766)
- Machine Readable Immigrant Visa (with temporary I-551 language)
- Temporary I-551 Stamp (on passport or I-94/I-94A)
- Arrival/Departure Record (I-94/I-94A)
- Arrival/Departure Record in foreign passport (I-94)
- Foreign Passport
- Certificate of Eligibility for Nonimmigrant Student Status (I-20)
- Certificate of Eligibility for Exchange Visitor Status (DS2019)
- Notice of Action (I-797)
- Document indicating membership in a federally recognized Indian tribe or American Indian born in Canada
- Certification from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR)
- Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) eligibility letter (if under 18) - This letter should NOT be submitted to VLP for electronic verification
- Document indicating withholding of removal
- Administrative order staying removal issued by the Department of Homeland Security
- Alien number (also called alien registration number or USCIS number) or I-94 number

**Important Reminder:** When approving Medicaid, the worker must ensure the applicant is a resident of Nebraska. A resident is defined as an individual living in the state voluntarily with the intent of making Nebraska his/her home. Contact with the individual may be required to ask additional questions regarding their intent to remain in the state. The information obtained from the individual should be documented in the case notes. Refer to the **Nebraska Residency Guide** for additional information.

**Resources:**
- The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website (uscis.gov) is full of information
- Workers can complete a search using plain language and simple searches
- The site provides information including definitions for statuses, codes, documents, etc.
- Searching a specific code or status in Google will provide definitions and leads to more information
- The **G-845 Immigration Documentation Process** has valuable information regarding a step 3 request
- NFOCUS Interim Release Notes from January 13, 2019 contain screenshots of steps to take

---

## Application Processing

### Central Office Review Requirements

Complex cases or questions can still be submitted to the Policy Questions mailbox for review. The steps contained in this document must be followed prior to submittal. This will aid in a faster review from Central Office staff and ensure a quick turnaround for the worker to determine eligibility.

**The following information must be included with the question:**
- Before the question is submitted, ensure a correct VLP request was submitted, and a response was received (Policy cannot review a pending response)
- If further documentation is needed, ensure a request has been made for immigration documents
- Master case name and number in the subject line
- Copies of all immigration documents or the specific Document Imaging sequence number(s) and date(s) for the documents if VLP is not available or inconclusive

**Important Note:** Determining an immigrant's eligibility is a multistep process. The worker must take into account not only their current immigration status, but how long the individual has had a valid immigration status (five-year bar), and state residency. Residency cannot be based solely on the immigration status, rather the worker must determine the individual's intent to reside in Nebraska. Refer to the **Nebraska Residency Guide** for additional information.

### Application Processing Procedures

**The following procedure should be followed for ALL applicants:**

### Scenario 1: Individual Attests to Eligible Immigration Status with Document Information

**If the "Is a US Citizen" and/or "Does have an eligible immigration status" questions are answered with 'yes' and document information is provided:**

1. Enter reported immigration information by selecting from the Detail Master Case window, Actions > US Citizenship and Immigration for all household members that are applying
2. Submit VLP request using the instructions from pages 9-10 of this guide
3. Once response is received, review to determine if the attested status was verified and that it meets an eligible status outlined in this guide
   - **If yes:** Continue reviewing Medicaid eligibility
   - **If response is pending or more information is needed:** Continue to Scenario 2 below

### Scenario 2: Individual Attests to Eligible Immigration Status but More Information Needed

**If the "Is __ a US Citizen" and/or "Does ___ have an eligible immigration status" questions are answered with 'yes' but does not provide the document type or answer the corresponding immigration questions:**

1. Review Document Imaging performing a permanent ID search to look for unexpired immigration documents
   - **If a document is located:** Complete the steps in Scenario 1 above
2. If unable to locate verification:
   - Attempt to contact the individual by phone to obtain information regarding the immigration status
     - **If unable to reach the individual:** Send a VR for immigration documents (Reasonable Opportunity would not apply)

### Scenario 3: Individual Attests to Eligible Immigration Status but More Time Needed

**If the "Is _____ a US Citizen" and/or "Does _____ have an eligible immigration status" questions are answered with 'yes' and document information is provided:**

1. Complete the steps in Scenario 1 above
2. If VLP does not provide a response in Step 1 and Step 2 or 3 of the VLP process have been initiated and the individual is otherwise eligible:
   - **Process Medicaid**
   - **Notify the individual(s) on the approval NOA of the Reasonable Opportunity Period**
   - **Set an alert for the case to be reviewed at the end of the Reasonable Opportunity Period**

### Scenario 4: Citizenship/Immigration Status Questions Incomplete

**Individual submits an application and the citizenship and/or lawful immigration status questions are incomplete - DO NOT immediately deny as an ineligible alien and follow the process below:**

**If the "Is _____ a US Citizen" and/or "Does _____ have an eligible immigration status" questions are not answered OR if the application indicates they are not a US Citizen but the "Does _____ have an eligible immigration status" question is unanswered or not displayed:**

1. Review Document Imaging performing a permanent ID search to look for unexpired immigration or citizenship documents
   - **If a document is located:** Complete the steps in Scenario 1 above
2. If unable to locate verification:
   - Attempt to contact the individual by phone to determine if they have an immigration status
     - **If the individual indicates yes:**
       - Attempt to collect the document details (noted in step b below) and move to steps 1-2 above
   - **If unable to reach the individual,** send a VR requesting the following information:

**VR Template:**
```
Does _____ have an immigration status? Yes or No.

If yes, please provide the details from your immigration document:
a. Document type. (I-94, I-327, I-20, I-571, DS2019, I-551 Permanent Resident Card, 
   I-766 Employment Authorization Card, Certificate of Citizenship or Naturalization, 
   VISA, *Passport, or Other).
   *If the document is a passport, please list the Country of Issuance.
b. Document Expire Date.
c. Document Number.

The worker may either submit a copy of the document, return a written statement with the 
information listed OR call the Customer Service Center at 1-855-632-7633 to discuss the 
immigration status.
```

**NOTE:** When a question is not answered or displayed, the information must be obtained by the worker. Refer to the "Unanswered Questions" document for additional information. This is crucial as an individual must first be determined as otherwise ineligible for Medicaid PRIOR to approving 599 CHIP or EMSA.

### Scenario 5: Individual Declares No Citizenship and No Lawful Immigration Status

**Individual declares no citizenship and indicates "No" to having a lawful immigration status, is pregnant, or has an emergency condition and is otherwise eligible:**

1. Deny Medicaid using denial reason of "Ineligible Alien"
2. **For pregnant woman:**
   - Review eligibility for the unborn under the 599 CHIP program by using the **599 CHIP Process Guide**
3. **For individuals with an emergency condition:**
   - Review eligibility under the EMSA program
   - See **SRT Process Guide** for additional information

---

## Renewal Processing

An individual's immigration status must be reviewed at renewal to determine if the individual has attested to a new status or if the status on file has expired or changed. This includes resubmitting a VLP request and acting on the response.

**Examples of status changes:**
- A lawful permanent resident may have become a naturalized citizen
- An individual here on a student visa may have expired the timeframe of their visa

---

## Updating Citizenship Verification Sources in NFOCUS

To assist with updating citizenship verification sources in NFOCUS, the following guidance has been developed. This section lists the verification source options available in NFOCUS, when they should be selected, and their verification level.

**Verification Priority:** When verifying citizenship status, verification should be attempted via primary sources, then secondary sources, and finally level three and four sources as a last resort.

**NOTE:** The Federal Data Services Hub, which includes Social Security and SAVE, is the primary citizenship verification source for Medicaid. If the individual's citizenship is verified via the HUB SSA Interface, then no additional citizenship verification is needed. Verification via the HUB SSA Interface can be viewed via the SSA Interface, Person Detail > Verifications, or the Verifications module in the NFOCUS Expert System.
