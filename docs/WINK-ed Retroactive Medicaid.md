- How to apply Nebraska Medicaid policies to retroactive eligibility determinations
- Verification procedures for earned income and resources for retroactive months
- Determining and applying resource spend-down when applicable
- When to pend retroactive Medicaid cases in NFOCUS

## Processing Retroactive Medicaid Based on Income Hierarchy

When determining income eligibility for retroactive months, whether MAGI or Non-MAGI, income must be verified according to the Nebraska Verification Plan. Staff should consult the Medicaid Income Handling Guide and Retroactive Medicaid Process for additional direction.

### Electronic Interface Hierarchy

Electronic interfaces must be utilized for retroactive months when available, following this hierarchy:

**1. IRS Tax/HUB**
- Must be used as the first verification source unless the household indicates the income source is new
- Provides federal tax information and household composition

**2. VCI/TALX**
- Use actual gross income for each retroactive month
- Provides quarterly wage information from employers

**3. SEW (State Earnings Wage)**
- Compare attested income to the most recent SEW quarter
- The most recent SEW quarter available can be used even if the retroactive month being budgeted does not fall within that quarter
- This allows for efficient verification when current quarter data is available

### Income Verification Requirements

**If a lead shows seasonal income:**
- Additional follow-up is required
- Income should be annualized for retroactive budgets
- Applies to both earned and unearned income sources
- Annualized income is allowable for MAGI and potentially allowable for Non-MAGI

**If electronic sources cannot verify income:**
- Request further information via Verification Request (VR)
- Request actual income received for each retroactive month OR
- Request annualized income if it is seasonal
- Explain the requirement clearly to the client in the VR comments
- See Words to Work By for proper phrasing

**Verification Request Due Dates:**
- VR due date may be 15 days or 30 days depending on the case situation
- See 477 NAC 16-001.14 for specific requirements

---

## Self-Employment Income for Retroactive Medicaid

Self-employment income requires special handling depending on the verification source provided.

### Using Tax Returns

**If the tax return is provided:**
- The pro-rated annualized amount must be used in the Retroactive Medicaid budget
- This ensures consistent application across all retroactive months

### Using Self-Employment Ledgers

**If using self-employment ledgers:**
- Actual income should be used for self-employment in the retroactive months
- Each month must be entered separately in the Other Income task for each retroactive month
- Moving forward, the averaged amount should be used for prospective eligibility

### Seasonal Self-Employment

**If a lead shows seasonal income:**
- Additional follow-up is required
- Income should be annualized for retroactive budgets
- Applies to both earned and unearned income sources
- Annualized income is allowable for MAGI and potentially allowable for Non-MAGI

**Regulatory Requirement:** See 477 NAC 16-001.14 – "To determine retroactive medical eligibility, each month's actual income shall be used unless an electronic data source is available and is reasonably compatible with the individual's attested income."

## Pending and Processing Retroactive Requests

Proper case management requires following specific procedures when all verifications are received.

### When to Pend the Case

**When all verifications are received to process the retro Medicaid request, pend the retro Medicaid case:**
- A retro Medicaid program case is only pended in NFOCUS when an eligibility determination can be completed (approval or denial)
- All retroactive months must be processed in one retro Medicaid program case
- Do not pend partial determinations

### Adding Administrative Roles

**Add any administrative roles to the retro Medicaid program case:**
- Administrative roles can be found on the application or in the pending or active Medicaid case
- Examples include authorized representatives, guardians, and legal representatives
- All notices must be sent to administrative roles as well as the applicant

### Running Budgets

**Run budgets for all retro months requested:**
- Determine eligibility for each month separately
- Each month stands alone for eligibility purposes
- Document the income and resources used for each month

### Sending Notices

**Send notice to the individual(s) and administrative role(s):**
- Every retro Medicaid request must have a notice sent when eligibility is determined
- This includes both approvals and denials of the retro Medicaid request
- Notices must go to all parties with standing (applicant and administrative roles)

---

## Retroactive Medicaid Notices

Every retroactive Medicaid request must have a notice sent when eligibility is determined, whether approved or denied. The notice must go to the individual and any Administrative Roles if applicable.

### Failure to Provide Verifications

**If requested verifications are not received:**
- Pend and deny the retro Medicaid case for Failure to Provide (FTP)
- This should only be done once the Verification Due alert has been received
- Never deny before the verification due date

**Important:** If the retro Medicaid case is denied due to FTP information:
- Eligibility for retro may still be determined any time within 6 months from the initial application date
- A new application is not necessary as long as verifications are provided within the 6-month timeframe from the application date
- The initial VR for retro can be resent to the client if needed

### Client Withdrawal

**If a request for retro is withdrawn by the individual:**
- Pend and deny the retro Medicaid case for Client Request
- Send a notice documenting the withdrawal
- Document the client's request in case comments

### Over Income Cases

**If the attested income is over the FPL:**
- Pend the case
- Enter the information into NFOCUS Expert to allow NFOCUS to determine eligibility
- The system will deny for Over Income and create a notice automatically
- Review the notice for accuracy before releasing

---

## Initial Applications Denied for Failure to Provide

Special procedures apply when an initial application was denied for failure to provide and the applicant submits verifications within the allowable timeframe.

### Processing Within 90 Days

**If an application month was denied for failure to provide and the applicant has turned in verifications within 90 days of the application date:**

1. Determine if Retroactive Medicaid was requested on the original application
2. Process the retroactive months as well as application month forward, if all verifications have been provided

### Partial Verification Scenarios

**If you cannot process the retroactive months but can process from the application month forward:**
- Notify the applicant of how many days they have left to provide verifications for the retroactive months
- Specify what verifications are still needed
- Calculate the remaining time within the 6-month window

### Important Timeframes

- The individual has **6 months** from the initial application date to provide required verification and have retro Medicaid eligibility determined
- Within the first **90 days**, both retroactive and prospective eligibility can be processed together
- After 90 days, only retroactive months can be processed if verifications are provided within the 6-month window

### Notice Requirements

**Make sure to send a notice of action (NOA) if the case is approved or denied:**
- If the client rescinds the Retroactive Medicaid request, the case must still be pended and then denied per Client Request
- Review the NOA to ensure the manual references are accurately applied
- Send to both the individual and any administrative roles

## Retroactive Medicaid for Non-MAGI Cases

Non-MAGI cases require resource verification in addition to income verification, following specific procedures.

### Initial Steps

**Determine whether the client has requested Retroactive Medicaid:**
- Review the application for the retroactive Medicaid request checkbox
- Check for medical expenses in the retroactive months
- Verify the timeframe requested

### Asset Verification

**Submit AVS request:**
- Follow the AVS Procedural Guide for detailed procedures
- Review the Medicaid Resource Verification Plan
- Request verification for all retroactive months needed

### Addressing Unanswered Questions

**If there are any unanswered questions, blank/skipped questions, or clarification is needed:**

**Attempt a call out to the applicant:**
- Obtain or clarify the blank/skipped questions
- Clarify confusing answers with the applicant
- Refrain from sending a generic verification request if contact can be made

**If contact is made:**
- Document each of the questions asked and answered by the client
- Ask clarifying questions on the resource(s) including:
  - Owner(s) of the resource
  - Current value
  - Account or policy number
  - Financial institution name and address

**If no contact was made:**
- Document when and why contact was attempted
- Create a detailed VR requesting an answer for each question that was missed
- Request all other verifications needed to process budgeting for each retroactive month

### Additional Resources

- Follow the Nebraska Verification Plan for verification hierarchy
- Review the Unanswered Questions document for proper procedures

**Reminder:** Do not pend Retro Medicaid until the request can be processed or denied.

## Resource Spend-down for Retroactive Medicaid

Resource spend-down allows applicants over the resource limit to use medical expenses to reduce countable resources, potentially establishing eligibility.

### When to Apply Resource Spend-down

Eligibility can be processed when all resources, income, and medical expenses have been verified. If the client will be denied due to excess resources, determine whether prior medical bills will reduce the resources prior to denying eligibility.

**Regulatory Authority:** 477-000-034 Resource Spend-down

### Resource Spend-down Process

**If the applicant/household is over resources for any of the retro months or application month:**

1. **Determine the amount over resources**
   - Calculate excess resources for each month
   - Document the amount over the limit

2. **Speak with the applicant(s) about medical expenses**
   - Identify medical expenses that occurred in the retro months
   - Determine if the attested expenses offset the amount of excess resources
   - Verify that expenses bring total resources at or below the maximum allowed

3. **Request verification of expenses**
   - If the expenses will offset the resources, request verification accordingly
   - Acceptable verification includes bills, receipts, and explanation of benefits (EOBs)

4. **Review examples at 477-000-034**
   - Examples of applying a resource spend-down can be found at this reference
   - Follow policy exactly as written

### Share of Cost Considerations

**If there is a monthly share of cost:**
- The amount of the reduction of resources will need to be added to the SOC
- The amount of reduction of resources will then be closed for the next month
- This returns the SOC to the original amount for subsequent months
- Additional examples of these actions can be found at 477-000-034

### Processing Requirements

**All retro months must be processed within one Retroactive Medicaid program case:**
- Do not split retroactive months across multiple cases
- Each month's eligibility stands alone but must be processed together
- Send one comprehensive notice covering all months
