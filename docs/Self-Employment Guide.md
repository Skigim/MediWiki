## Key Definitions

**Self-Employment (SE)**: An activity or work effort performed by the individual for the purpose of generating income. DHHS providers (Child Care, Chore, Transportation, PAS) are always considered self-employed.

**Operating Expenses**: All expenses related to producing goods or services without which the goods or services could not be produced. These are deductible from gross income.

**Significant Change**: A change in income that is outside the normal, anticipated fluctuation for the business and affects ongoing income levels.

**Tax/Hub**: The primary verification source for MAGI applications that provides tax return information from the IRS.

**VCI/TALX and SEW Interfaces**: Secondary verification sources that can be used as leads for self-employment but should not be used to verify income as individuals must be allowed to claim SE expenses.

**Seasonal Income**: Income that fluctuates predictably during specific months of the year (examples: construction, lawn service, snow removal).

**Self-Employment Ledgers**: Monthly records of actual income received and actual expenses paid for a self-employment business.

**Schedule C**: IRS tax form for reporting profit or loss from business (Profit or Loss From Business).

**Schedule E**: IRS tax form for reporting supplemental income including rental real estate, royalties, and S-corp/Partnership income.

**Schedule F**: IRS tax form for reporting profit or loss from farming operations.

**Business Use of Home**: An allowable expense for self-employed individuals who operate their business from their residence (Form 8829).

**Contract Work**: Work where taxes are removed from pay and the individual receives a W-2 or 1099 form (may not be considered self-employment).

---

## Initial Review Requirements

Each potential self-employment situation should be reviewed on its own merits.

### MAGI Applications - Tax/Hub First

The Tax/Hub is always used as the first verification source on MAGI applications.

- If the Tax/Hub does not pass compatibility or a change has been reported, the case must be reviewed to determine whether the tax return or self-employment ledgers are required
- The VCI/TALX and SEW interfaces can be used as a lead for self-employment but should not be used to verify income as the individual needs to be allowed to claim SE expenses

### Information to Document

When reviewing information on the case file, document the start date in the narrative:

- The date the individual started the SE may not be the first month income started
- Determine if an income tax return or self-employment ledgers should be used

### Key Determination Questions

**Has the individual filed a tax return that includes their self-employment?**

- If yes, the tax return may be used
- If the business was not in operation for the full year, the income can be prorated
- If no, self-employment ledgers should be used

**Is the income from self-employment or from contract work?**

- Are taxes removed from the pay?
- Will they receive a W2 or 1099 form?

### Special Consideration

DHHS providers (Child Care, Chore, Transportation, PAS) are always considered self-employed regardless of payment method.

## Income Verification Methods

### Tax Returns

Tax returns are the preferred verification method when available and reflective of current income.

**When to Use Tax Returns:**

- The individual has filed a tax return that includes their self-employment income
- The tax return is reflective of current income
- The business was in operation for the full year (or income can be prorated)

**Entering Tax Return Income:**

Income tax returns are entered into the Self-Employment Income module in the NFOCUS Expert system (Financial → Self-Employment Income).

- The Business tab must be filled out with business information, tax year being used, and all other information listed
- If the individual has Farming income (Schedule F), click "Yes" on this screen to enable the Schedule F tab
- Each schedule of the tax return must be entered under the appropriate schedule tab

### Self-Employment Ledgers

Ledgers are used when tax returns are not available or not reflective of current income.

**When to Use Ledgers:**

- The individual has not filed a tax return that includes their self-employment
- A significant change has occurred making the tax return non-reflective
- The income is irregular or fluctuating

**How Many Ledgers Are Needed?**

Medicaid requires one month of regular income. However, workers must use critical thinking:

- If the household begins self-employment during the month of application, use actual income for the first month and projected income for months forward
- If the individual has been self-employed for at least one whole month and attests the income is reflective, only one ledger is needed
- If the income is irregular, the three most recent months are needed
- If the income fluctuates (has predictable fluctuations during specific months of the year), up to 12 months may be needed

**Completing Ledgers:**

- A separate ledger is needed for each instance of self-employment (Example: A household self-employed in both childcare and lawn care would provide a separate ledger for each business)
- Self-employment ledgers are not converted, they are averaged (see the MAGI SE Calculator)
- Self-employment ledgers can be completed by phone when processing initial, renewal, and change management cases
- All pertinent information should be collected: description and amount of income received, type and amount paid for expenses
- Ledgers completed by phone do not need to be signed, but it should be documented in the narrative that they were completed in this manner
- Ledgers completed by phone must be uploaded to Document Imaging
- Self-Employment ledgers are found in MERL under Tools - Applicable To All Cases

**Entering Ledger Income:**

When budgeting income using ledgers, enter the computed monthly income from the Self-Employment ledgers into the "Other Income" module in the NFOCUS Expert system as Med Self-Employment Gain (or Loss) along with a description.

Use critical thinking skills and document how the income determination was made (e.g., what months were used, what expenses were used, why 3 months or 12 months were used, etc.). For help computing the monthly average, see the MAGI SE Calculator.

---

## Seasonal and Fluctuating Income

Determine if the income fluctuated throughout the year. Examples: construction, lawn service, snow removal.

### Budgeting Seasonal Income

Certain jobs have a clear history of predictable fluctuations or other indications of future changes in income:

- In these instances, it is allowable to budget using up to 12 months of ledgers or whatever number of ledgers is reflective to account for the fluctuations
- Documentation in the narrative should explain why the income was calculated using the specified ledgers

**Example:** An individual who is self-employed in construction might provide only 5 ledgers. Say the ledgers are for August, September, October, November, and December. They show the fluctuation from busy-season to off-season and are reflective of the projected annual income. These 5 ledgers should be used to determine current income.

---

## Significant Changes

The determination of significant change is based on a twofold process:

- The individual reports a significant change in income
- The worker determines if the change is outside the normal fluctuation

### Example 1: Normal Fluctuation

Betty Jones has a day care business, and her tax return is used to compute her income. At renewal, she reports her income will be reduced by half over the summer until enrollment picks up again when school starts.

**Is this a significant change?** No, this is a normal, anticipated fluctuation.

**How should her income be computed?** Continue to use her tax return to compute the income.

### Example 2: Significant Change

Bob Smith is a self-employed carpet installer. His tax return is used to compute his income. At renewal he reports he and his business partner split up four months ago. (Not an actual partnership.)

**Is this a significant change?** Yes, this is a significant change.

**How should his income be computed?** The individual should complete ledgers listing actual income and actual expenses effective from the date of significant change.

### Example 3: Conditional Change

Mary Evans became a Child Care Block Grant provider nine months ago. She has been reporting her income and expenses on ledgers. Within her certification period she calls to report she is pregnant, and the doctor has ordered her not to lift more than five pounds. She is going to stop providing infant care but wants to continue with school age childcare.

**Is this a significant change?** It depends - we need to know more about Mary's situation.

**Follow-up questions to ask:**

- Is this a temporary situation?
- Will your overall net income change?

**Determining the Answer:**

- It IS NOT a significant change if Mary's income minus expenses is only temporarily reduced. This would be considered a normal fluctuation. Continue to budget the income using the established average.
- It IS a significant change if Mary states her intention is to provide childcare for only school age children from now on causing an ongoing reduction in her income.

**How should her income be computed if there is a significant change?**

Ledgers will need to be completed with an estimate of her income and expenses for three months starting from the date of the significant change. Use this to compute a new three-month average. At renewal, ledgers will need to be completed showing her actual income and actual expenses.

## Self-Employment Ledgers

### Ledger Requirements

A separate ledger is needed for each instance of self-employment.

**How Many Ledgers:**

- Medicaid requires one month of regular income
- Use critical thinking to determine if additional months are needed
- If income is irregular, use the three most recent months
- If income fluctuates seasonally, up to 12 months may be needed

**Completion Method:**

Self-employment ledgers can be completed by phone when processing initial, renewal, and change management cases.

- All pertinent information should be collected: description and amount of income received, type and amount paid for expenses
- Ledgers completed by phone do not need to be signed
- Document in the narrative that ledgers were completed by phone
- Ledgers completed by phone must be uploaded to Document Imaging

**Location:**

Self-Employment ledgers are found in MERL under Tools - Applicable To All Cases.

### Entering Ledger Income

When budgeting income using ledgers:

- Enter the computed monthly income from the Self-Employment ledgers into the "Other Income" module in the NFOCUS Expert system as Med Self-Employment Gain (or Loss) along with a description
- Use critical thinking skills and document how the income determination was made
- Document what months were used, what expenses were used, why 3 months or 12 months were used, etc.
- For help computing the monthly average, see the MAGI SE Calculator

### Termination of Self-Employment

Termination of self-employment income may be obtained verbally as long as the business has ceased operating and all necessary information is collected from the individual.

**Required Information:**

- The name of the self-employed individual
- Name or type of self-employment business
- Gross income and expenses for the final month of operation
- Date the income was received

**Documentation:**

The form for Terminated Self-Employment can be found at: Tools - MAGI - Terminated Self-Employment Telephone Form

- If the form is utilized, the form must be uploaded to Document Imaging after completion

**Important Exception:**

If the individual has an S-corp, partnership or LLC, a verbal statement cannot be taken from the individual and verification of the dissolution is required.

See: Policy Log – Chapter 16 – Partnership or S-Corp Dissolution

## Tax Return Processing

### Issue 1: New Tax Return Submitted

When a new tax return is filed with the IRS and received by the agency, it is considered a significant change that must be acted on.

- It is not acceptable to document that the Tax Return is "Reasonably Compatible" with the income in the current budget and take no further action

See 477-000-011

### Issue 2: Renewals and Income Tax Returns

When processing a renewal and self-employment was previously verified using the individual's tax return:

- The individual should be contacted to see if a new tax return has since been filed with the IRS

**If yes:** The new tax return must be requested.

**If no:** Ask the individual if the current tax return is reflective.

- If declared reflective, process the renewal
- If the tax return is not reflective or you are unable to reach the individual:
  - Send a VR if working a paper renewal
  - Send a paper renewal form and change the program case mode to Processing if working a Desk Renewal

**Special Note:**

If the individual attests a return was not filed for the current tax year (e.g., Renewal is being processed in 2022 and the tax return in the current budget is for Tax Year 2020) and also attests their intent to file, the previous year's return can continue to be used as long as it remains reflective. The individual will need to report the new return when it is filed. If there is no intent to file, offer the individual the opportunity to complete SE ledgers.

### Form 1040 Tax Return

The Form 1040 shows the income that has been received by the individual and the applicable schedules which may be attached to the return (e.g., Schedule 1, Schedule C, Schedule D, Schedule E, Schedule F).

**Note:** Schedule D is for Capital Gains/Losses and Dividends, which is not considered self-employment but is countable income.

For more information on Capital Gains/Losses and Dividends, see: Policy Log – Ch 16 MAGI Other Income Q&A (1099, Capital Gains, Interest, Dividends)

### Schedule 1 - Additional Income and Adjustments

**PART I – Additional Income:**

In addition to income from the 1040, this section provides information related to any unearned income, business/self-employment income, rental income, farm income, partnerships/S-corps, etc.

- Not all income listed on the Schedule 1 is considered self-employment but should still be reviewed as it may be countable

**PART II - Adjustments to Income:**

This section provides information regarding deductions that may be used in MAGI budgets.

- Example: Student loan interest, self-employment tax, self-employed health insurance deduction, etc.

For specific information on allowable deductions see:

- MAGI Income Deductions WINK-ed
- MAGI Deductions Guide

### Schedule C - Profit or Loss From Business

Self-employment income will show on Schedule C – Profit or Loss From Business.

**Entering Schedule C Income:**

- The income is entered in the Self-Employment Income Module in Expert under Sched C and Form 8829 (Line 29)
- The Business Use of home is an allowable expense and should be entered on Line 30

### Schedule E - Supplemental Income and Loss

Rental real estate, royalties, and S-corp and Partnership income will show on Schedule E – Supplemental Income and Loss.

**S-corp and Partnership Income:**

If the individual is part of an S-corp or Partnership, this will show on Part II of the Schedule E. The Schedule K-1 should be requested if the tax return is for a couple who is filing joint taxes, as the K-1 is used to verify percentage of ownership for Partnerships/S-corps.

For more information, including how to enter this income, see MAGI Partnership and S-corp Income on MERL.

**Entering Schedule E Income:**

Rental real estate and royalty income is entered in the Self-Employment Income module in NFOCUS Expert under Sched E and Form 4835.

### Schedule F - Profit or Loss From Farming

Farming Income is considered self-employment and will show on the Schedule F – Profit or Loss From Farming.

**MAGI Budgets:**

- The income is entered in the Self-Employment Income module in NFOCUS Expert under the Sched F tab (Line 34) profit or loss, as applicable
- Staff should only enter Line 34 for MAGI budgets, and no other information should be entered on this tab

**Non-MAGI Budgets:**

- The income is entered in the Self-Employment Income module in NFOCUS Expert under the Sched F tab (Line 9) profit or loss, as applicable
- Staff no longer need to add Depreciation on this screen as the NFOCUS system will automatically count this information
- If staff inadvertently add Depreciation, the amount of income used in the budget will be incorrect

## Allowable Expense Disregards

### MAGI Self-Employment Disregards

**477 NAC 16-001.07B – Disregards for Self-Employment:**

All operating expenses related to producing the goods or services and without which the goods or services could not be produced are deducted from gross income.

**477 NAC 16.001.07C – Operating Expenses – Farm Income:**

All expenses related to farm income are considered operating expenses and are allowable.

**Processing Guidelines:**

- If using a tax return, all expenses and deductions will already be included in the totals entered. Staff should not question the expense information listed on the tax return.
- If using ledgers, the expenses will be attested to by the individual. Staff should allow each deduction that the individual claims, if applicable to the business. Staff should not question information or dig into the expenses unless information does not appear to be accurate.

**Important Note:**

Personal expenses unrelated to the business are not allowed (e.g., it would not be acceptable to count part of mortgage payment as an expense if the business is not run from the home).

### Non-MAGI Self-Employment Disregards

**477 NAC 22-003.03 Self-Employment:**

Self-employment is an activity or work effort performed by the individual for the purpose of generating income. Passive receipt of income from a resource does not constitute self-employment. For self-employed individuals, the net amount of income, after payment of expenses, is used to determine eligibility. Gross income and expenses must be verified. If the self-employed individual files taxes on this source of income, then the taxable amount of income from the self-employment may be used.

**003.03(A) OFFSET OF INCOME:**

Losses from self-employment may be used to offset other earned income of the individual or a financially responsible spouse or relative. Self-employment losses cannot be used to offset unearned income.

**Processing Guidelines:**

- If using a tax return, all expenses and deductions will already be included in the totals entered. Staff should not question the expense information listed on the tax return.
- If using ledgers, the expenses will be attested to by the individual. Staff should allow each deduction that the individual claims, if applicable to the business. Staff should not question information or dig into the expenses unless information does not appear to be accurate.

**Important Note:**

Personal expenses unrelated to the business are not allowed (e.g., part of mortgage payment if the business is not run from the home).
