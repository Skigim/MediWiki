Medicare Part D Co-pay Deductions Q & A
Q1: Who does this impact?
Medicaid recipients who have a Share of Cost budget. Recipients without a Share of Cost may
also have the co-pays, but the deduction would not apply to their budget.
Q2: What to do?
Medicare co-pays are an allowable deduction to the Share of Cost. Verify the amount of co-pay
that is due. After this is verified, you will need to run or re-run the budget for the applicable
month. This is not an adverse action since the amount is being reduced. The expense is entered
in Expert under Share of Cost Adjustment in the Expense tab. Be sure to use the Description box
to note that this is a co-pay expense. When entering the expense, you will have to enter a
frequency. The only Frequency option available is monthly, so you will need to control the
frequency using the Begin Date and End Date boxes. You will need to make sure that an End
Date is entered unless you have confirmed the expense will continue into future months. See the
corresponding instructions for more detailed steps in this process.
Q3: How to verify?
You can do this either through requesting a copy of the Medicare EOB or by contact with the
pharmacy.
Q4: Doesn’t Medicaid cover the co-pays?
For Medicaid recipients eligible as QMBs, Medicare Part A and B co-pays are covered.
Medicaid does not pay any costs which should be covered by Medicare Part D, whether the
person is enrolled in Medicare Part D or not. However, any Medicare co-pay is an allowable
deduction from their SOC amount.
Q5: How much is the co-pay?
This will depend on which Medicare D plan the person has and can vary by living arrangement.
Q6: Can we use an average amount?
No. The actual amount owed should be used in the budget. A best practice would be to discuss
with the recipient or their representative that co-pays can be used as a deduction. You could also
include a comment on the initial Notice of Action that co-pays may be due, but can be used as a
deduction in the budget. The recipient will need to report any co-pay expenses in order to be
included.
Steps to Adding the Medicare Copay Expense to a Prior Month’s
Budget
1. Make sure the expense has been verified prior to entering.
2. Access the Expenses module in the expert system and select “Add”.
3. Select the individual the expense applies to.
4. Select “Medical” for the category.
5. Choose “Share of Cost Adjustment” from the Type dropdown list.
6. Add a brief description.
7. Enter the verified amount and begin date of the copay expense(s).
8. IMPORTANT!! Enter the end date, unless it has been verified the copay is an ongoing
expense.
9. Select the appropriate verification source.
10. Select “OK” or “Next”
11. Once the expense has been added, go to the Eligibility/Budgeting module.
12. Select the benefit month to recalculate.
13. Process, view and check budget for accuracy prior to approval.
Example:
Anne Adams is an MN/SOC budget effective January 2019. In March she provides an
Explanation of Benefits which verifies she had $57 in Medicare part D copay costs in January.
The SSW recalculates the January budget after adding this expense, which decreases the SOC
from $953.50 to $896.50. The adjustment is viewed in the budget summary (next page) by
double-clicking the “Additional Excess Income” line.
Original January budget, created 1-16-19
Recalculated January budget with Share of Cost Adjustment – created 3/10/19
