# Medicare Part D Co-pay Deductions
*Guidance for Applying Medicare Prescription Co-pays as Share of Cost Adjustments*

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for applying Medicare Part D prescription co-pays as allowable deductions to Share of Cost (SOC) budgets for Medicaid recipients. While Medicaid covers Medicare Part A and B co-pays for QMB-eligible individuals, Medicaid does not pay costs covered by Medicare Part D. However, any Medicare Part D co-pay is an allowable deduction that reduces the recipient's Share of Cost amount.

The guide includes Q&A format clarifications on who is impacted, verification procedures, and step-by-step instructions for entering Medicare co-pay expenses in the N-FOCUS Expert system. Staff must verify actual co-pay amounts and properly control frequency using begin and end dates to ensure accurate budget calculations and appropriate SOC reductions for recipients.

**Document Date:** Current  
**Scope:** Applies to all Medicaid recipients with Share of Cost budgets who incur Medicare Part D prescription co-pays

**Medicare Part A** – Hospital insurance coverage under Medicare

**Medicare Part B** – Medical insurance coverage under Medicare (doctor visits, outpatient care)

**Medicare Part D** – Prescription drug coverage plan under Medicare; co-pays are NOT covered by Medicaid but are allowable SOC deductions

**Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB)** – Medicaid category where Medicaid pays Medicare Part A and B premiums, deductibles, and co-insurance

## Purpose & Legal Context

**Purpose of Guidance:**
To ensure staff correctly apply Medicare Part D prescription co-pays as allowable deductions to Share of Cost budgets, reducing recipient financial burden while maintaining accurate budget calculations and proper system documentation.

**Policy Foundation:**

**Medicaid Coverage:**
- For QMB-eligible recipients: Medicaid covers Medicare Part A and B co-pays
- For all recipients: Medicaid does NOT pay any costs that should be covered by Medicare Part D, whether person is enrolled in Medicare Part D or not

**Allowable Deduction:**
- Any Medicare Part D co-pay IS an allowable deduction from SOC amount
- Must be verified and entered in Expert system
- Reduces Share of Cost for applicable month(s)

**Not Adverse Action:**
This is not an adverse action since the amount is being reduced (favorable to recipient). No advance notice required.

## Section 1: Who is Impacted

### Q1: Who does this impact?

**Answer:**

**Primary Impact: Medicaid recipients who have a Share of Cost budget.**

**Also Affected (But No Budget Impact):**
Recipients without a Share of Cost may also have the co-pays, but the deduction would not apply to their budget.

**Why No Impact for Non-SOC Recipients:**
- Recipients without Share of Cost already have full Medicaid coverage
- Co-pay deduction only matters when there's a Share of Cost to reduce
- These recipients still owe the Medicare Part D co-pays, but it doesn't affect Medicaid eligibility or budget

**Examples of Impacted Recipients:**

**Impacted:**
- MN/SOC budgets with excess income
- Individuals with medically needy spenddown
- Recipients in facilities with Share of Cost

**Not Impacted (for budget purposes):**
- Full coverage Medicaid (no SOC)
- SSI recipients
- Categorically eligible individuals

**Key Point:** All Medicaid recipients with Share of Cost budgets should be informed that Medicare Part D co-pays can reduce their monthly Share of Cost obligation.

## Section 2: How to Process Medicare Co-pay Deductions

### Q2: What to do?

**Answer:**

Medicare co-pays are an allowable deduction to the Share of Cost. Follow this process:

**Step 1: Verify the Amount**
Verify the amount of co-pay that is due.

**Step 2: Run or Re-run the Budget**
After verification, you will need to run or re-run the budget for the applicable month.

**Step 3: Understand This is NOT Adverse Action**
This is not an adverse action since the amount is being reduced.

**Step 4: Enter in Expert System**
The expense is entered in Expert under **Share of Cost Adjustment** in the Expense tab.

**Step 5: Add Description**
Be sure to use the Description box to note that this is a co-pay expense.

**Step 6: Control Frequency**
When entering the expense, you will have to enter a frequency. The only Frequency option available is monthly, so you will need to control the frequency using the **Begin Date** and **End Date** boxes.

**Critical Requirement:**
You will need to make sure that an **End Date is entered** unless you have confirmed the expense will continue into future months.

**Detailed Instructions:**
See Section 6 for corresponding step-by-step instructions for more detailed steps in this process.

## Section 3: Verification Requirements

### Q3: How to verify?

**Answer:**

You can verify Medicare Part D co-pays through either of two methods:

**Method 1: Medicare Explanation of Benefits (EOB)**
- Request a copy of the Medicare EOB
- EOB shows services received and co-pays charged
- Provides official documentation of amounts owed
- Best practice for written verification

**Method 2: Pharmacy Contact**
- Contact the pharmacy directly
- Pharmacy can confirm co-pay amounts
- Useful when EOB not readily available
- Document pharmacy contact information and verification details

**Verification Documentation:**

**What to Document:**
- Source of verification (EOB or pharmacy contact)
- Date of verification
- Amount of co-pay
- Month(s) co-pay applies to
- Any pattern of ongoing expenses

**Best Practice:**
- Request verification for all months with co-pays
- Document verification source in N-FOCUS
- Save EOB copies to Document Imaging
- For pharmacy contact, document contact name and date

## Section 4: Medicaid Coverage of Co-pays

### Q4: Doesn't Medicaid cover the co-pays?

**Answer:**

It depends on the type of co-pay and the recipient's eligibility category.

**Medicare Part A and B Co-pays:**

**For Medicaid recipients eligible as QMBs (Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries):**
- Medicare Part A and B co-pays ARE covered by Medicaid
- QMB status means Medicaid pays Medicare premiums, deductibles, and co-insurance
- Recipients do not pay these co-pays

**Medicare Part D Co-pays:**

**For ALL Medicaid recipients (including QMBs):**
- Medicaid does NOT pay any costs which should be covered by Medicare Part D
- This applies whether the person is enrolled in Medicare Part D or not
- Recipients are responsible for Medicare Part D co-pays

**Important Allowable Deduction:**

However, any Medicare Part D co-pay IS an allowable deduction from their SOC amount.

**Summary:**

| Co-pay Type | QMB Coverage | Non-QMB Coverage | SOC Deduction |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| Part A | Medicaid pays | Not covered | N/A (Medicaid pays) |
| Part B | Medicaid pays | Not covered | N/A (Medicaid pays) |
| Part D | NOT covered | NOT covered | YES - allowable |

**Why This Matters:**

Recipients may be confused about why they owe Part D co-pays when Medicaid covers Parts A and B. Staff should explain:
- Part D coverage is separate
- Medicaid doesn't pay Part D costs
- But co-pays reduce their Share of Cost
- This provides financial relief even though Medicaid doesn't pay directly

## Section 5: Co-pay Amount Determination

### Q5: How much is the co-pay?

**Answer:**

This will depend on which Medicare Part D plan the person has and can vary by living arrangement.

**Factors Affecting Co-pay Amount:**

**Factor 1: Medicare Part D Plan**
- Each Part D plan has its own formulary
- Co-pay amounts vary by plan
- Tier system affects co-pay (generic vs. brand)
- Plan-specific cost-sharing structures

**Factor 2: Living Arrangement**
- Nursing facility residents may have different co-pays
- Community residents have standard Part D plan co-pays
- Some facilities negotiate different arrangements
- Living arrangement can affect which medications and co-pays apply

**Factor 3: Medication Tier**
- Tier 1 (generic): Typically lowest co-pay
- Tier 2 (preferred brand): Mid-range co-pay
- Tier 3 (non-preferred brand): Higher co-pay
- Specialty tier: Highest co-pay

**Factor 4: Coverage Phase**
- Initial coverage period: Standard co-pays
- Coverage gap/"donut hole": Different cost-sharing
- Catastrophic coverage: Reduced co-pays

**Important:** Because these factors vary significantly, actual amounts must be verified—averages cannot be used.

### Q6: Can we use an average amount?

**Answer:**

No. The actual amount owed should be used in the budget.

**Why Actual Amounts Required:**

1. **Accuracy:** Budgets must reflect actual expenses
2. **Fairness:** Recipients entitled to exact deduction amount
3. **Verification:** Policy requires verified amounts
4. **Variability:** Co-pays vary too much for averages to be reliable

**Best Practices:**

**Practice 1: Discuss with Recipient**
A best practice would be to discuss with the recipient or their representative that co-pays can be used as a deduction.

**Practice 2: Include Notice Comment**
You could also include a comment on the initial Notice of Action that co-pays may be due, but can be used as a deduction in the budget.

**Practice 3: Require Reporting**
The recipient will need to report any co-pay expenses in order to be included.

**Suggested Notice Language:**

> *"If you incur Medicare Part D prescription co-pays, please report them to your eligibility worker. These co-pays can be used to reduce your monthly Share of Cost amount. Please provide your Medicare Explanation of Benefits (EOB) or pharmacy receipt showing the co-pay amount."*

**Ongoing Communication:**

- Inform recipients at application/renewal
- Remind recipients when reviewing SOC
- Encourage monthly reporting of co-pays
- Explain potential savings from reporting

### Example Case

**Scenario:**
Anne Adams is an MN/SOC budget effective January 2019. In March she provides an Explanation of Benefits which verifies she had $57 in Medicare Part D copay costs in January.

**Action:**
The SSW recalculates the January budget after adding this expense, which decreases the SOC from $953.50 to $896.50.

**Viewing the Adjustment:**
The adjustment is viewed in the budget summary by double-clicking the "Additional Excess Income" line.

**Budget Comparison:**

**Original January Budget (created 1-16-19):**
- Share of Cost: $953.50
- No Medicare Part D co-pay adjustment

**Recalculated January Budget (created 3-10-19):**
- Share of Cost: $896.50
- Medicare Part D co-pay adjustment: $57.00
- Net reduction: $57.00

**Documentation:**
- Expense entered with begin date 1/1/19, end date 1/31/19
- Description: "Medicare Part D co-pay January 2019"
- Verification: Medicare EOB dated 3/5/19
- Budget recalculated 3/10/19
