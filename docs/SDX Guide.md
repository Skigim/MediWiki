Definitions:
Beneficiary Data Exchange (BENDEX/BDE) – A file exchange from the Social Security Administration
(SSA) that reports Social Security information to the State of Nebraska for individuals who have either applied
for, or are receiving public assistance benefits. See the BDE Process Guide for additional information.
Current Pay (CP) – Currently receiving a physical check/payment from the Social Security Administration.
Disabled Adult Children (DAC) – The Disabled Adult Child (DAC), or Childhood Disability Beneficiaries
(CDB) category, is a category of Medicaid eligibility. In most states, Medicaid eligibility for the Aged or
Disabled is dependent upon eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). This category was created in
order to protect Medicaid eligibility for persons who have been disabled from a young age who may lose their
SSI benefits solely because they begin to receive Social Security benefits due to the retirement, death, or
disability of a parent. If the recipient would remain eligible for SSI benefits without considering the additional
Social Security income from their parents, then the recipient qualifies as a DAC. If a recipient loses SSI due to
receiving benefits from a parent’s Railroad Retirement or Veteran’s Administration claim, or due to their own
income, resources, or Social Security benefit they do not qualify as a DAC. See the DAC Guide.
Early Widows or Widowers – Individuals that receive Title II benefits and a portion of those Title II benefits
can be deducted in determing their Medicaid eligibility when all four factors are met found in 477 NAC 22-
005.02(K)(ii)(4).
Medical Insurance for Workers with Disabilities (MIWD) – Working individuals who meet the necessary
disability criteria, have income within income guidelines, and are working are eligible for Medicaid. After
application of income disregards, individuals with income less than 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level
(FPL) are eligible for Medicaid with no premium; individuals with incomes of 200 through 249 percent of the
FPL are eligible for Medicaid with a monthly premium payment. See the MIWD Eligibility Process Guide.
Non-Pay (NP) – Not receiving a physical check/payment from the Social Security Administration.
Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (RSDI) – Retirement, survivors, and disability benefits paid
to workers, their dependents, and survivors. RSDI is commonly referred to as Social Security.
Social Security Administration (SSA) – A U.S. government agency that administers social programs covering
disability, Medicare, retirement, and survivors' benefits.
Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) – A payroll tax-funded, federal insurance program of the United
States government. It is managed by the SSA, and is designed to provide income supplements to people who are
physically restricted in their ability to be employed because of a notable disability; usually a physical disability.
SSDI can be supplied on either a temporary or permanent basis, usually directly correlated to whether the
person's disability is temporary, or permanent.
State Data Exchange (SDX) – A file exchange from SSA that reports SSI information to the State of Nebraska
for individuals who have either applied for or are receiving public assistance benefits.
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) – A means-tested program administered by SSA for aged and disabled
individuals who meet certain guidelines. This program differs from RSDI in that it is not dependent upon work
history, and is based on age, disability, and financial need.

1619(b) – A special Medicaid status for individuals who received Medicaid and SSI in the month before the
month in which this reference applies and whose SSI payment stopped due to the level of earnings.
Purpose: The purpose of the SDX Process Guide is to provide guidance for staff when navigating the various
alerts received via the SDX interface, and to combine all information into a single, streamlined document. The
guide is separated into several different sections:
Section 1 provides general guidance regarding the SDX interface; Section 2 provides direction regarding specific
alerts and interfaces regularly handled in the field; Section 3 provides direction regarding individuals who are
1619(b) eligible; Section 4 provides direction regarding married couples with only one current pay SSI spouse;
Section 5 is miscellaneous, and provides direction regarding address mismatch, suspension, and non-pay of SSI
benefits processes.
Reminder: Staff should review all pertinent information on the SDX Interfaces screens prior to
contacting SSA with questions.
Interfaces may also include partial information or not answer all questions that need to be clarified when
processing an application, change, or a renewal. It may be necessary for the worker to call out to another agency
or the individual, etc. to clarify information further.

SECTION 1: What To Do When an SDX Alert is Received
When an SDX alert is received, the following action should be taken:
Identify the person in the alert. A Master Case may have several members who have applied, been
recently approved, or are currently receiving SSI benefits. Make sure you are viewing the
information for the person identified in the alert. If an individual was approved as the result of an
SSA appeal, certain factors will need to be considered prior to approving Medicaid. Refer to the
MLTC Processing Guide for procedures.
1. Check the payment status for SSI benefits:
a) If the person remains Current Pay (CP):
i. Check the address in the Demographics screen to ensure that the address on file with SSA matches
the address known to the agency. If the address does not match, refer to the Address Mismatch
section of the guide.
b) If the person is in Non-Pay (NP) status, refer to the SSI Enters NP Status sections of the guide.
c) Determine if the participant has 1619(b) status:
- Verify in the SDX Special Medicaid Status field (See SDX Payment screen below).
i. If 1619(b) eligible, refer to SECTION 3: Verification of Earned Income for 1619(b).
ii. If 1619(b) has ended, refer to SECTION 3: Alert #37: 1619B Ineligibility
2. Check the SDX Financial tab for income (See SDX Financial screen below);
a) SSA monitors income for SSI individuals. However, there are times when SSI will end due to other
income. The SDX Financial tab will alert a worker to other sources of income, like Veterans Affairs
(VA), or RSDI benefits received on a spouse, or a parent’s claim. The other income source will
show up in the Unearned Income Type box at the bottom of the SDX Financial screen.
PAS MLTC Updated 4/2025

b) If this source is from an SSA claim, then check the BDE interface to see if the claim information is
shown. In most cases, the additional claim will appear in the BDE interface as well. If the
information is not in BDE, a State Verification Exchange System (SVES) Claim Request must be
sent with the claim numbers shown in SDX in order to bring the new information into NFOCUS.
View BDE Process Guide for instructions on how to send an SVES Claim/SSN request.
Reminder: Do not assume that all information is known to the agency and close the alert without
checking SDX.

SECTION 2: SDX Interfaces and Alerts
SSI Enters Non-Pay Status Due to Income or Resources:
SDX Interface: Non-Pay- Countable income exceeds SSI payment amount.
SDX Interface: Non-Pay- Countable resources exceeds SSI payment amount.
When an individual who is CP status enters NP status due to income or resources, the individual may retain his/her
disability status for up to 12 months from the date NP status begins. DHHS is responsible for reviewing financial
eligibility (income and resources).
In order for Medicaid to continue, the following factors must be considered:
For individuals moving to a Non-Pay status a current application or renewal form is not required. The case must
continue with its current eligibility period and renewal date.
1. Review for other eligibility:
a. Verify that the individual maintains their disability by reviewing the interface.
b. Review for other Non-MAGI eligibility (aged, blind, etc.). See the following guides for additional
information: DAC Guide, Early Widow/Widower and MIWD Eligibility Process Guide.
i. Resources will need to be verified prior application for AVS consent or use the
Consent Line to obtain.
ii. Submit an AVS request by using the AVS Procedural Guide.
c. Review for MAGI eligibility. If participant has a child, review for Parent/Caretaker. If there are no
children or they fail Parent/Caretaker bugeting, review for MAGI Expansion/HHA eligibility. Refer
to Adult MAGI Budgeting Flowchart.
d. Refer to the applicable sections of the MLTC Processing Guide to complete processing the
application in another Medicaid category or close the case for the applicable reason of ‘Eligilibility
Requirements Not Met’.
Additional Considerations When Non-Excludable or Countable Resources Exceed SSI limit:
When a individual begins NP status due to “Non-Excludable Resources Exceed SSI Limit”, or “Countable
Resources Exceed SSI Payment Amount”, the resource section of the SDX financial tab must be viewed and an
AVS request may be needed at this time. (See SDX Financial screen below).

This section will show Vehicle, House, Other, Income Producing Property, Life Insurance, and Direct Deposit.
Most resource types will have Yes or No displayed. Direct Deposit will have Checking, Savings, or No
displayed.
1. If resources are declared:
a. Review the SDX Financial tab to determine if the resources shown correspond with the individual’s
attestation on the application or renewal form;
i. If Yes: Process the case accordingly.
ii. If No: Proceed to #2.
2. If there is a discrepancy between the individual’s attestation and what is shown in the SDX Financial
Resources tab, such as a “Yes” listed for “Other”:
a. Call SSA and clarify what resource is putting the individual over SSI limits prior to sending a VR.
b. Once the information is clarified, refer to the Medicaid Resource Verification Plan to determine if a
VR is appropriate.
Additional Considerations For When An Individual Loses SSI Eligibility Due to Income and Resources:
1. If information is provided regarding income and resources, determine eligibility under the Non-MAGI
program.
2. If information is not provided regarding income and resources, review for continuous eligibility.
3. If the income and/or resources exceed Non-MAGI guidelines, review for eligibility under the
appropriate MAGI category.
Alert #406: Individual State Change:
An SDX record was received for an individual indicating a move to another state. However, the residence and
physical addresses have not been updated in the SDX Demographics tab. This alert should be treated as a lead.
Review Application Summary, Alerts, Change Reports, Document Imaging, and Narratives (MLTC & EA) for
changes reported regarding a move out of or back into the state. If no information is found, or if there is a lead
that the individual still resides in Nebraska:
Attempt a call-out to the individual:
1. If successful:
a. If the individual remains a CP-SSI recipient and declares intent to reside in Nebraska, accept
declaration of Nebraska residency unless it is not reasonably compatible.
b. If the individual declares they no longer reside in Nebraska, close the case using reason of
Unable to Locate/Moved and send a NOA with an updated address.
2. If unsuccessful:
a. Send a speednote to the individual informing them of their need to contact SSA to update their
address.
b. If the speednote or other mail is being returned it is likely that DHHS and SSA do not know
where the individual is. The worker must follow the Returned Mail Process for additional
action.

changes reported regarding the death of the individual.
a. If able to confirm the death of the individual by these sources, close for Death of Participant.
b. If unable to confirm the death of the individual by these sources, contact the SSA to determine
their source of information, and close for Death of Participant, if verified.
Alert #413: Out of State SSI Received:
An SDX record was received for an individual, and the state of residence on the SSI database is not Nebraska.
This alert should be treated as a lead.
1. Review Application Summary, Alerts, Change Reports, Document Imaging, and Narratives (MLTC
& EA) for changes reported regarding a move out of or back into the state.
1. If there is lead that the individual currently resides in Nebraska:
i. Determine if the case is pending, recently approved, or ongoing.
1. If pending, or recently approved:
a. Determine if the individual/POA/guardian has declared their intent to reside
in Nebraska.
i. If yes, accept declaration of Nebraska residency unless it is not
reasonably compatible, and verbally inform the individual to
contact SSA to update their address.
NOTE: If the individual has recently moved to Nebraska, it could
take some time for SSA to update their records.
1. Manually enter the SSI income and SSI FBR in Expert prior
to processing budgets, if necessary.
ii. If no, deny/close the case using reason Unable to Locate/Moved.
2. If ongoing:
a. Attempt a call-out to the individual.
i. If successful:
1. And the individual/POA/guardian declares their intent is to
reside in Nebraska:
a. Update the individual’s address, etc. in NFOCUS.
b. Inform the individual of their need to contact SSA
to update their address.
ii. If unsuccessful:
a. Send a speednote to the individual informing them
of their need to contact SSA to update their address.

Alert #434: Interface Record:
The Interface Record is run monthly and includes SDX, BDE, IUC, and Long-Term Care (LTC) rate changes.
When this alert is received for SDX the worker must:
1. Compare the payment amount shown in SDX to what is shown in Unearned Income in the Expert
system in NFOCUS.
a. If the payment amounts match, no action needs to be taken.
b. If the payment amounts do not match:
i. Update the amount in Unearned Income to the current SDX amount.
ii. Process budgets accordingly.

and
ii. Process accordingly if they do qualify; or
iii. Deny the participant for the appropriate closure reason if they do not qualify for
other Medicaid programs.
Alert #527: SSI Status Changed:
The individual's SSI payment status has changed.

SECTION 3: Verification of Earned Income for 1619(b)
Alert #36: 1619(b) Eligibility:
Former SSI recipients who are part of the 1619(b) program retain their eligibility for Medicaid when they return
to work, even if the SSI is no longer CP. When their benefits are processed, the earned income must be entered
into the Expert system in NFOCUS in order for the budgets to correctly show the 1619(b) status. The earned
income has already been verified by the SSA, so no additional verification is needed. The following steps show
how to find and enter the earned income for 1619(b) recipients.
NOTE: this process is only for eligibility determinations for 1619(b) recipients. The SDX file provides the net
income, and cannot be used to determine eligibility for other individuals the 1619(b) recipient may be
financially responsible for.
Reminder: Recipients of 1619(b) are categorically eligible for Medicaid.
To Update a Non-MAGI Case:
1. View the payment screen of the SDX interface file to determine whether the individual remains 1619(b).
This status is shown in the Special Medicaid Status box. (See SDX Payment screen below)
2. In order for the budget to correctly show that the individual has 1619(b) status, earned income must be
entered into Expert. Because the SSA has already verified the income, you can use the amount in the
SDX file in Expert. View the Financial screen in SDX to get the earned income amount. (See SDX
Financial screen below).
PAS MLTC Updated 4/2025



## Page 13

3. Enter the amount noted as earned income in SDX into Expert as verified earned income. Use SDX File
Viewed as the verification source.
4. Process the budget for the first month. The budget will change from AABD/OMB to 1619(b).
PAS MLTC Updated 4/2025



## Page 14

To Update a Combined Case:
1. Follow the MAGI Verification Plan to verify the household’s gross income.
2. Enter the verified attested income or paystubs into Expert, using the appropriate verification
source.
NOTE: If using VCI information or paystubs, you will need to be sure to use the
gross amount.
3. Process the budget for the first month. The ABD/OMB budget will change to 1619(b).
Reminder: The income shown in the SDX file may not correspond with the income in SEW.
Verify all income for MAGI cases processed with 1619(b).
Alert #37: 1619B Ineligibility:
An SDX record was received for an individual indicating that their 1619(b) eligibility had ended. Eligibility
could have ended due to earnings, resources, or they may have returned to Current Pay status. If Social Security
finds an individual ineligible for 1619(b) because of excess income (earned or unearned) or resources, Social
Security does not terminate the individual, but the individual goes into a 12-month suspension period. Workers
will need to review for eligibility in other programs.
PAS MLTC Updated 4/2025

SECTION 4: Married Couples, Only One Current Pay SSI Spouse
If the non-SSI spouse IS listed as an ineligible relative and as a spouse on the SDX interface:
• SSA considers the couple a single economic unit for the purposes of SSI.
• SSA is monitoring the income and resources of both spouses together, and no additional verification of
income or resources is needed for the couple if the non-SSI spouse is not applying for Medicaid.
• If the non-SSI spouse is also applying for Medicaid benefits, income and/or resource verifications must be
obtained to determine the non-SSI spouse’s eligibility. Medicaid eligibility for the SSI spouse and the non-
SSI spouse must be determined in separate Medicaid program cases.
• If the SSI spouse remains Current Pay SSI at renewal, a desk renewal should be completed for the SSI
spouse only 477 NAC 3-007.03 – 007.03(C).
• For the non-SSI spouse, a renewal application is needed. This includes gathering income and resource
verifications for the non-SSI spouse’s renewal to be complete. If they fail to complete the renewal or
provide verifications, only the non-SSI spouse can be denied or closed.

1. Review the individual’s NFOCUS address history.
2. Is the address in SDX the individual’s old address that was previously listed in NFOCUS?
YES—Send the individual a speednote to inform them their old address is still on file with SSA, and
they should update their address to avoid any future interruption in benefits.
NO—Update the individual’s address to the new address verified in SDX.
If the individual remains CP SSI with a Nebraska physical address, but there is an out of state mailing address
listed in SDX:
1. Update the mailing address to the out of state address.
Reminder: Do not close the individual’s Medicaid case if the individual is CP- SSI and a Nebraska
physical address is listed in SDX.
SDX Interface: Suspended – Address Unknown:

where the individual is. The worker must follow the Returned Mail Process for additional action.
SDX Interface: Non-Pay - Cessation of Disability:
For individuals moving to a Non-Pay status a current application or renewal form is not required. The case must
continue with its current eligibility period and renewal date.
1. Review for other eligibility:
a. Review for other MAGI or Non-MAGI eligibility (aged, blind, etc.) including MAGI Expanstion and
if the individual has a child, review for Parent/Caretaker.
b. If the individual has no children or they fail Parent/Caretaker bugeting, refer to the Adult MAGI
Budgeting Flowchart and/or follow the SRT Process Guide for more information.
c. Refer to the applicable sections of the MLTC Processing Guide as needed.
SDX Interface: Non-Pay – Not a U.S. Citizen or Eligible Alien:
DHHS is responsible for reviewing financial and non-financial eligibility, including a qualified non-citizen
status.
This alert refers to an individual whose SSI ended as they have reached the maximum number of years (7) in a
certain non-citizen status, and have not adjusted to an allowable immigration status with the Social Security
Office within that time period. SSA places time limits on certain qualified non-citizens, however; Medicaid has
not imposed those same limits. SSA and Medicaid have different criteria for non-citizen status, so while an
PAS MLTC Updated 4/2025

individual may no longer be eligible for SSA benefits, Medicaid eligibility may continue once a full review is
completed. When an individual enters a Non-Pay status due to this reason, the individual may retain the
disability status for up to 12 months from the date the Non-Pay status begins.
For individuals moving to a Non-Pay status a current application or renewal form is not required. The case must
continue with its current eligibility period and renewal date.
1. Review for other eligibility:
2. Verify that the individual maintains their disability by reviewing the interface.
3. Review for other Non-MAGI eligibility (aged, blind, MIWD, etc.).

6. VLP must be requested to verify current non-citizen status. See the Qualified Non-Citizen Status
Eligibility and MLTC Citizenship and Immigration Guide for additional information.
7. If the individual no longer meets a qualified non-citizen status, assign to the EMSA position number
(75013343) if a medical emergency exists. See the EMSA Process Guide for additional information.
SDX Interface: Non-Pay – Outside United States:
In this situation, the individual has been determined by the SSA to have left the country, and is no longer in CP
status. SSA does not make payments when a beneficiary is out of the country. This could mean that the
individual is on vacation, or has moved away. In all cases where this alert is found, the worker must attempt to
contact the household to determine if the individual is still considered a resident of Nebraska.
Attempt a call to the individual:
1. If successful:
a. Inform the individual of their need to contact SSA and update their information.
2. If unsuccessful:
a. Send a speednote to the individual informing them of their need to contact SSA to update
their information.
b. If the speednote or other mail is being returned it is likely that DHHS and SSA do not know
where the individual is. The worker must follow the Returned Mail Process for additional
action.
SDX Interface: Suspension- Individual is Inmate of Penal Institution:
When an SDX or BDE alert is received by the Universal Worker indicating that an individual is incarcerated
and their Social Security benefits have been suspended the worker must review the Suspending Medicaid for
Incarcerated Individuals Guide for more information.
