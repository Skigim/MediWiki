## Key Definitions

**Beneficiary Data Exchange (BENDEX/BDE)** – A file exchange from the Social Security Administration (SSA) that reports Social Security information to the State of Nebraska for individuals who have either applied for or are receiving public assistance benefits. See the BDE Process Guide for additional information.

**Current Pay (CP)** – Currently receiving a physical check or payment from the Social Security Administration.

**Disabled Adult Children (DAC)** – The Disabled Adult Child (DAC), or Childhood Disability Beneficiaries (CDB) category, is a category of Medicaid eligibility. In most states, Medicaid eligibility for the Aged or Disabled is dependent upon eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). This category was created to protect Medicaid eligibility for persons disabled from a young age who may lose their SSI benefits solely because they begin to receive Social Security benefits due to the retirement, death, or disability of a parent. See the DAC Guide for additional information.

**Early Widows or Widowers** – Individuals that receive Title II benefits where a portion of those Title II benefits can be deducted in determining their Medicaid eligibility when all four factors are met (see 477 NAC 22-005.02(K)(ii)(4)).

**Medical Insurance for Workers with Disabilities (MIWD)** – Working individuals who meet necessary disability criteria, have income within guidelines, and are working are eligible for Medicaid. After application of income disregards, individuals with income less than 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) are eligible for Medicaid with no premium; individuals with incomes of 200 through 249 percent of the FPL are eligible for Medicaid with a monthly premium payment. See the MIWD Eligibility Process Guide for details.

**Non-Pay (NP)** – Not receiving a physical check or payment from the Social Security Administration.

**Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (RSDI)** – Retirement, survivors, and disability benefits paid to workers, their dependents, and survivors. RSDI is commonly referred to as Social Security.

**Social Security Administration (SSA)** – A U.S. government agency that administers social programs covering disability, Medicare, retirement, and survivors' benefits.

**Supplemental Security Income (SSI)** – A means-tested program administered by SSA for aged and disabled individuals who meet certain guidelines. This program differs from RSDI in that it is not dependent upon work history and is based on age, disability, and financial need.

**State Data Exchange (SDX)** – A file exchange from SSA that reports SSI information to the State of Nebraska for individuals who have either applied for or are receiving public assistance benefits.

## Purpose & Scope

The purpose of the SDX Process Guide is to provide comprehensive guidance for staff navigating various alerts received via the SDX interface. The guide streamlines information into the following sections:

- **Section 1:** General guidance regarding the SDX interface and initial alert response procedures
- **Section 2:** Direction regarding specific alerts and interfaces regularly handled in the field
- **Section 3:** Procedures for individuals who are 1619(b) eligible
- **Section 4:** Direction regarding married couples with only one current pay SSI spouse
- **Section 5:** Miscellaneous procedures including address mismatch, suspension, and non-pay processes

**Important Reminders:**
- Staff should review all pertinent information on the SDX Interfaces screens prior to contacting SSA with questions.
- Interfaces may include partial information or not answer all questions that need clarification when processing an application, change, or renewal.
- It may be necessary for the worker to call other agencies or the individual to clarify information further.

## Section 1: What to Do When an SDX Alert is Received

When an SDX alert is received, take the following actions in order:

### 1.1 Identify the Person in the Alert

A Master Case may have several members who have applied, been recently approved, or are currently receiving SSI benefits.

- Make sure you are viewing the information for the person identified in the alert
- If an individual was approved as the result of an SSA appeal, certain factors will need to be considered prior to approving Medicaid
- Refer to the MLTC Processing Guide for procedures

### 1.2 Check the Payment Status for SSI Benefits

The payment status determines the appropriate next steps:

**If the person remains Current Pay (CP):**
- Check the address in the Demographics screen to ensure that the address on file with SSA matches the address known to the agency
- If the address does not match, refer to the [Address Mismatch](#address-mismatch-individual-remains-cp-different-nebraska-address) section of this guide

**If the person is in Non-Pay (NP) status:**
- Refer to the SSI Enters Non-Pay Status sections of Section 2

### 1.3 Determine if the Participant Has 1619(b) Status

- Verify in the SDX Special Medicaid Status field (See SDX Payment screen)
- If 1619(b) eligible, refer to [Section 3: Verification of Earned Income for 1619(b)](#section-3-verification-of-earned-income-for-1619b)
- If 1619(b) has ended, refer to [Alert #37: 1619B Ineligibility](#alert-37-1619b-ineligibility)

### 1.4 Check the SDX Financial Tab for Income

SSA monitors income for SSI individuals. However, there are times when SSI will end due to other income sources.

**Actions:**
1. Review the SDX Financial tab for other sources of income (Veterans Affairs, RSDI benefits on a spouse's or parent's claim, etc.)
2. If the source is from an SSA claim, check the BDE interface to see if the claim information is shown
3. In most cases, the additional claim will appear in the BDE interface as well
4. If the information is not in BDE, a State Verification Exchange System (SVES) Claim Request must be sent with the claim numbers shown in SDX to bring the new information into NFOCUS

**Reminder:** Do not assume that all information is known to the agency and close the alert without checking SDX.

## Section 2: SDX Interfaces and Alerts

### 2.1 SSI Enters Non-Pay Status Due to Income or Resources

**Alert Types:**
- Non-Pay: Countable income exceeds SSI payment amount
- Non-Pay: Countable resources exceeds SSI payment amount

**Important:** When an individual who is CP status enters NP status due to income or resources, the individual may retain his/her disability status for up to 12 months from the date NP status begins. DHHS is responsible for reviewing financial eligibility (income and resources).

**For individuals moving to a Non-Pay status:**
- A current application or renewal form is **not** required
- The case must continue with its current eligibility period and renewal date

#### 2.1.1 In Order for Medicaid to Continue

1. **Review for other eligibility:**
   - Verify that the individual maintains their disability by reviewing the interface
   - Review for other Non-MAGI eligibility (aged, blind, etc.)
   - See the DAC Guide, Early Widow/Widower Guide, and MIWD Eligibility Process Guide for additional information
   - Resources will need to be verified prior to application or use the Consent Line to obtain
   - Submit an AVS request using the AVS Procedural Guide

2. **Review for MAGI eligibility:**
   - If participant has a child, review for Parent/Caretaker eligibility
   - If there are no children or they fail Parent/Caretaker budgeting, review for MAGI Expansion/HHA eligibility
   - Refer to Adult MAGI Budgeting Flowchart

3. **Refer to applicable sections of the MLTC Processing Guide** to complete processing the application in another Medicaid category or close the case for the appropriate reason of "Eligibility Requirements Not Met"

#### 2.1.2 Additional Considerations When Non-Excludable or Countable Resources Exceed SSI Limit

When an individual begins NP status due to "Non-Excludable Resources Exceed SSI Limit" or "Countable Resources Exceed SSI Payment Amount":

1. **View the resource section of the SDX financial tab** – This section will show:
   - Vehicle
   - House
   - Other
   - Income Producing Property
   - Life Insurance
   - Direct Deposit (displays Checking, Savings, or No)

2. **If resources are declared:**
   - Review the SDX Financial tab to determine if the resources shown correspond with the individual's attestation on the application or renewal form
   - If Yes: Process the case accordingly
   - If No: Proceed to Step 3

3. **If there is a discrepancy** between the individual's attestation and what is shown in the SDX Financial Resources tab (such as "Yes" listed for "Other"):
   - Call SSA and clarify what resource is putting the individual over SSI limits prior to sending a VR
   - Once the information is clarified, refer to the Medicaid Resource Verification Plan to determine if a VR is appropriate

#### 2.1.3 Additional Considerations for When an Individual Loses SSI Eligibility Due to Income and Resources

1. If information is provided regarding income and resources, determine eligibility under the Non-MAGI program
2. If information is not provided regarding income and resources, review for continuous eligibility
3. If the income and/or resources exceed Non-MAGI guidelines, review for eligibility under the appropriate MAGI category

### 2.2 Alert #406: Individual State Change

**Situation:** An SDX record was received for an individual indicating a move to another state. However, the residence and physical addresses have not been updated in the SDX Demographics tab. This alert should be treated as a lead.

**Procedure:**
1. Review Application Summary, Alerts, Change Reports, Document Imaging, and Narratives (MLTC & EA) for changes reported regarding a move out of or back into the state
2. If no information is found, or if there is a lead that the individual still resides in Nebraska, proceed with call-out

**If able to contact the individual:**
- If the individual remains a CP-SSI recipient and declares intent to reside in Nebraska, accept declaration of Nebraska residency unless it is not reasonably compatible
- If the individual declares they no longer reside in Nebraska, close the case using reason of "Unable to Locate/Moved" and send a NOA with an updated address

**If unable to contact the individual:**
- Send a speednote informing them of their need to contact SSA to update their address
- If the speednote or other mail is being returned, it is likely that DHHS and SSA do not know where the individual is. Follow the Returned Mail Process for additional action.

### 2.3 Alert #409: Death Date Reported

**Situation:** An SDX record was received confirming the death of the participant. This alert should be treated as a lead.

**Procedure:**
1. Review Alerts, Change Reports, Document Imaging, Vital Statistics, and Narratives (MLTC & EA) for changes reported regarding the death of the individual
2. If able to confirm the death by these sources, close for "Death of Participant"
3. If unable to confirm the death by these sources, contact SSA to determine their source of information, then close for "Death of Participant" if verified

### 2.4 Alert #413: Out of State SSI Received

**Situation:** An SDX record was received for an individual where the state of residence on the SSI database is not Nebraska. This alert should be treated as a lead.

**Procedure:**
1. Review Application Summary, Alerts, Change Reports, Document Imaging, and Narratives (MLTC & EA) for changes reported regarding a move

2. **If there is a lead that the individual currently resides in Nebraska:**
   - Determine if the case is pending, recently approved, or ongoing

3. **If pending or recently approved:**
   - Determine if the individual/POA/guardian has declared their intent to reside in Nebraska
   - If yes: Accept declaration of Nebraska residency unless it is not reasonably compatible, and verbally inform the individual to contact SSA to update their address. NOTE: If the individual has recently moved to Nebraska, it could take some time for SSA to update their records. Manually enter the SSI income and SSI Federal Benefit Rate (FBR) in Expert prior to processing budgets, if necessary.
   - If no: Deny/close the case using reason "Unable to Locate/Moved"

4. **If ongoing:**
   - Attempt a call-out to the individual
   - If successful and individual/POA/guardian declares intent to reside in Nebraska: Update the individual's address in NFOCUS and inform them to contact SSA to update their address
   - If successful but unable to confirm intent to reside: Follow Returned Mail Process
   - If unsuccessful: Send a speednote informing them to contact SSA to update address. If mail is being returned, follow the Returned Mail Process for additional action.

5. **If there are no leads that the individual is still residing in Nebraska:**
   - Close the case using reason "Unable to Locate/Moved"

### 2.5 Alert #434: Interface Record

**Situation:** The Interface Record is run monthly and includes SDX, BDE, IUC, and Long-Term Care (LTC) rate changes. When this alert is received for SDX:

1. Compare the payment amount shown in SDX to what is shown in Unearned Income in the Expert system in NFOCUS
   - If the payment amounts match, no action needs to be taken
   - If the payment amounts do not match:
     - Update the amount in Unearned Income to the current SDX amount
     - Process budgets accordingly

### 2.6 Alert #455: SSI Claim Denied

**Situation:** The individual's claim through the SSA has been denied.

**Procedure:**
1. View SDX interface for information relating to the current eligibility status
2. Review for eligibility
3. If denied by the SSA for "Non-disability/Lack of Severity/Lack of Duration":
   - Review the individual's eligibility for other Medicaid programs
   - Process accordingly if they qualify
   - Deny the participant for the appropriate closure reason if they do not qualify for other Medicaid programs

### 2.7 Alert #527: SSI Status Changed

**Situation:** The individual's SSI payment status has changed.

**Procedure:**
1. View SDX interface to determine the reason for the status change
2. Review for eligibility by following procedures within the SDX Process Guide that pertain to the SSI status change reason

---

## Section 3: Verification of Earned Income for 1619(b)

### 3.1 Overview of 1619(b)

**1619(b) Definition:** A special Medicaid status for individuals who received Medicaid and SSI in the month before the month in which this reference applies and whose SSI payment stopped due to the level of earnings.

**Key Point:** Recipients of 1619(b) are **categorically eligible** for Medicaid.

**Important Note:** This process is only for eligibility determinations for 1619(b) recipients. The SDX file provides the net income and cannot be used to determine eligibility for other individuals the 1619(b) recipient may be financially responsible for.

### 3.2 Alert #36: 1619(b) Eligibility

**Situation:** Former SSI recipients who are part of the 1619(b) program retain their eligibility for Medicaid when they return to work, even if the SSI is no longer CP. When their benefits are processed, the earned income must be entered into the Expert system in NFOCUS in order for the budgets to correctly show the 1619(b) status.

**Important:** The earned income has already been verified by the SSA, so no additional verification is needed.

#### 3.2.1 To Update a Non-MAGI Case

1. View the payment screen of the SDX interface file to determine whether the individual remains 1619(b)
   - This status is shown in the Special Medicaid Status box
2. Because the SSA has already verified the income, you can use the amount in the SDX file in Expert
3. View the Financial screen in SDX to get the earned income amount
4. Enter the amount noted as earned income in SDX into Expert as verified earned income
   - Use "SDX File Viewed" as the verification source
5. Process the budget for the first month
   - The budget will change from AABD/OMB to 1619(b)

#### 3.2.2 To Update a Combined Case

1. Follow the MAGI Verification Plan to verify the household's gross income
2. Enter the verified attested income or paystubs into Expert using the appropriate verification source
   - **NOTE:** If using VCI information or paystubs, ensure you use the gross amount
3. Process the budget for the first month
   - The ABD/OMB budget will change to 1619(b)

**Reminder:** The income shown in the SDX file may not correspond with the income in SEW. Verify all income for MAGI cases processed with 1619(b).

### 3.3 Alert #37: 1619B Ineligibility

**Situation:** An SDX record was received for an individual indicating that their 1619(b) eligibility had ended. Eligibility could have ended due to earnings, resources, or they may have returned to Current Pay status.

**Important:** If Social Security finds an individual ineligible for 1619(b) because of excess income (earned or unearned) or resources, Social Security does not terminate the individual. Instead, the individual goes into a 12-month suspension period.

**Procedure:** Workers will need to review for eligibility in other programs following the guidance in Section 2.1 above.

---

## Section 4: Married Couples with Only One Current Pay SSI Spouse

### 4.1 When the Non-SSI Spouse IS Listed as an Ineligible Relative and Spouse on the SDX Interface

- SSA considers the couple a single economic unit for the purposes of SSI
- SSA is monitoring the income and resources of both spouses together, and no additional verification of income or resources is needed for the couple if the non-SSI spouse is not applying for Medicaid
- If the non-SSI spouse is also applying for Medicaid benefits, income and/or resource verifications must be obtained to determine the non-SSI spouse's eligibility
- **Important:** Medicaid eligibility for the SSI spouse and the non-SSI spouse must be determined in separate Medicaid program cases
- If the SSI spouse remains Current Pay SSI at renewal, a desk renewal should be completed for the SSI spouse only (see 477 NAC 3-007.03)
- For the non-SSI spouse, a renewal application is needed. This includes gathering income and resource verifications for the non-SSI spouse's renewal to be complete
- If they fail to complete the renewal or provide verifications, only the non-SSI spouse can be denied or closed

---

## Section 5: Address Mismatch, Suspension, and Non-Pay Processes

### 5.1 Address Mismatch (Individual Remains CP; Different Nebraska Address)

**Situation 1: Different Nebraska address listed in SDX**

1. Review the individual's NFOCUS address history
2. Is the address in SDX the individual's old address that was previously listed in NFOCUS?
   - **YES:** Send the individual a speednote informing them their old address is still on file with SSA and they should update their address to avoid future interruption in benefits
   - **NO:** Update the individual's address to the new address verified in SDX

**Situation 2: Nebraska physical address with out-of-state mailing address**

If the individual remains CP SSI with a Nebraska physical address but there is an out-of-state mailing address listed in SDX:
- Update the mailing address to the out-of-state address

**Important Reminder:** Do not close the individual's Medicaid case if the individual is CP-SSI and a Nebraska physical address is listed in SDX.

### 5.2 SDX Interface: Suspended – Address Unknown

**Situation:** SSA uses this code when they need to speak with the individual. This could be for address unknown, or for a non-medical update for changes in income, resources, or living arrangement.

**Procedure:**

**If able to contact the individual:**
1. Update the individual's address in NFOCUS
2. Inform the individual of their need to contact SSA and update their address

**If unable to contact the individual:**
- If DHHS is aware of the individual's address, leave the address that is listed in NFOCUS
- Send a speednote informing them of their need to contact SSA to update their address
- If the speednote or other mail is being returned, it is likely that DHHS and SSA do not know where the individual is. Follow the Returned Mail Process for additional action.

### 5.3 SDX Interface: Suspended – Representative Payee Development Pending

**Situation:** This SDX alert is received when a new payee is being assigned. It can sometimes take a few months to complete a payee change.

**Procedure:**
1. Attempt to contact the individual or last-known Power of Attorney (POA) to verify if they have requested a new payee
2. If unable to contact the individual/POA, send a speednote requesting that they contact the SSA to request a new payee (see 477 NAC 22-004.03(B))
3. You can also contact the SSA to determine if there is another Representative Payee being vetted

**Important Reminder:** Do not close individuals who become NP-SSI due to a pending Representative Payee.

### 5.4 SDX Interface: Suspended - Returned Check

**Situation:** SSA uses this code when they need to speak with the individual. This could be due to the individual's routing number being incorrect, a representative payee returning the check, or the individual returning the check.

**Procedure:**

**If able to contact the individual:**
- Inform the individual of their need to contact SSA and update their information

**If unable to contact the individual:**
- Send a speednote informing them of their need to contact SSA to update their information
- If the speednote or other mail is being returned, it is likely that DHHS and SSA do not know where the individual is. Follow the Returned Mail Process for additional action.

**Important Reminder:** Do not close individuals who become suspended due to a returned check.

### 5.5 SDX Interface: Non-Pay - Failure to Furnish Required Report

**Procedure:**

**If able to contact the client:**
- Inform the individual of their need to contact SSA and update their information

**If unable to contact the client:**
- Send a speednote informing them of their need to contact SSA to update their information
- If the speednote or other mail is being returned, it is likely that DHHS and SSA do not know where the individual is. Follow the Returned Mail Process for additional action.

### 5.6 SDX Interface: Non-Pay - Cessation of Disability

**For individuals moving to a Non-Pay status:**
- A current application or renewal form is not required
- The case must continue with its current eligibility period and renewal date

**Procedure:**

1. **Review for other eligibility:**
   - Review for other MAGI or Non-MAGI eligibility (aged, blind, etc.) including MAGI Expansion
   - If the individual has a child, review for Parent/Caretaker eligibility
   - If the individual has no children or they fail Parent/Caretaker budgeting, refer to the Adult MAGI Budgeting Flowchart and/or follow the SRT Process Guide for more information

2. **Refer to applicable sections of the MLTC Processing Guide** as needed

### 5.7 SDX Interface: Non-Pay – Not a U.S. Citizen or Eligible Alien

**Situation:** This alert refers to an individual whose SSI ended because they have reached the maximum number of years (7) in a certain non-citizen status and have not adjusted to an allowable immigration status with the Social Security Office within that time period.

**Important Context:** SSA places time limits on certain qualified non-citizens, however; Medicaid has not imposed those same limits. SSA and Medicaid have different criteria for non-citizen status, so while an individual may no longer be eligible for SSA benefits, Medicaid eligibility may continue once a full review is completed.

**Important:** When an individual enters a Non-Pay status due to this reason, the individual may retain the disability status for up to 12 months from the date the Non-Pay status begins.

**For individuals moving to a Non-Pay status:**
- A current application or renewal form is not required
- The case must continue with its current eligibility period and renewal date

**Procedure:**

1. Verify that the individual maintains their disability by reviewing the interface
2. Review for other Non-MAGI eligibility (aged, blind, MIWD, etc.)
3. If participant has a child, review for Parent/Caretaker eligibility
4. If there are no children or they fail Parent/Caretaker budgeting, review for HHA eligibility
5. Refer to the Adult MAGI Budgeting Flowchart and MLTC Processing Guide as applicable
6. Request VLP to verify current non-citizen status
   - See the Qualified Non-Citizen Status Eligibility and MLTC Citizenship and Immigration Guide for additional information
7. If the individual no longer meets a qualified non-citizen status, assign to the EMSA position number (75013343) if a medical emergency exists
   - See the EMSA Process Guide for additional information

### 5.8 SDX Interface: Non-Pay – Outside United States

**Situation:** The individual has been determined by the SSA to have left the country and is no longer in CP status. SSA does not make payments when a beneficiary is out of the country. This could mean that the individual is on vacation or has moved away.

**Important:** In all cases where this alert is found, the worker must attempt to contact the household to determine if the individual is still considered a resident of Nebraska.

**Procedure:**

**If able to contact the individual:**
- Inform the individual of their need to contact SSA and update their information

**If unable to contact the individual:**
- Send a speednote informing them of their need to contact SSA to update their information
- If the speednote or other mail is being returned, it is likely that DHHS and SSA do not know where the individual is. Follow the Returned Mail Process for additional action.

### 5.9 SDX Interface: Suspension - Individual is Inmate of Penal Institution

**Situation:** When an SDX or BDE alert is received indicating that an individual is incarcerated and their Social Security benefits have been suspended:

**Procedure:** Review the "Suspending Medicaid for Incarcerated Individuals Guide" for more information and complete procedures.

---

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Always Review SDX Screens First** – Before contacting SSA with questions, review all pertinent information on the SDX interface screens to ensure you have the most current information.

✓ **Check Payment Status Early** – Determining whether the individual is in Current Pay (CP) or Non-Pay (NP) status is the critical first step in processing any SDX alert.

✓ **Address Discrepancies Matter** – Address mismatches between SDX and NFOCUS can result in service interruptions. Always investigate and update records accordingly.

✓ **Non-Pay Provides 12-Month Disability Retention** – When an individual enters NP status due to income, resources, or certain other reasons, they may retain disability status for up to 12 months, allowing time to explore other eligibility categories.

✓ **1619(b) Income Already Verified** – For 1619(b) cases, earned income is pre-verified by SSA, so no additional verification is needed. Simply enter the SDX amount into Expert.

✓ **Don't Close Prematurely** – Many suspension statuses (returned check, rep payee pending, address unknown) should not result in case closure. Attempt contact and follow proper procedures.

✓ **Contact Attempts Are Required** – Most non-pay and suspension situations require attempts to contact the individual or POA before sending notifications or considering case closure.

✓ **Coordinate with Multiple Systems** – SDX information must be coordinated with BDE interface, NFOCUS Expert system, and multiple eligibility guides to ensure comprehensive, accurate case processing.
