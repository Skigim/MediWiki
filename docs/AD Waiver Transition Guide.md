Worker Process for Adult In-Home Waiver Cases Transitioning from
Assigned to Universal Caseload
AD Waiver In-Home Cases
1. Initial Implementation: Communication was provided to all Area Agency on Aging (AAA) and
League of Human Dignity partners statewide by HCBS staff.
2. Effective August 17, 2020, workers with Adult In-Home waiver caseloads will begin
transitioning their cases to the Universal Caseload (UC).
3. Workers voicemail and email signature will be updated on the effective date of the transition to
reflect the change in customer service. (See the attached recommended script below).
Cases That Will Remain Assigned To An Ongoing Worker:
1. Spousal Impoverishment (SIMP), cases with on-going trust dispersals, and other identified cases
will remain permanently assigned to the current worker, or designated worker if caseloads are
consolidated.
2. Any case in the process of SRT Determination or a resource spend down will remain assigned to
the current worker until that process is completed.
3. Cases with an identified resource deprivation should be assigned to a worker from the time the
deprivation is discovered until the final amount and penalty period have been determined.
4. Cases where a question has been submitted to the Policy Questions mailbox will remain assigned
until the question is answered and any resulting actions have been taken.
5. During this transition, renewals that are past due or due by September 30, 2020 will remain
assigned to the current worker. The case will be moved to UC at the completion of the renewal.
6. Cases with a delayed closing due to the State of Emergency will remain assigned to the current
worker until the State of Emergency ends and the case is closed or until the closing reason is
resolved, whichever is first.
Assigning Cases To Universal Caseload
1. Adult In-Home Waiver cases will move to UC for ongoing case management.
2. NFOCUS LTC indicators must be set to “On” for all cases.
a. Workers will review the indicator at initial application, renewal, or during another
transfer to UC.
b. The LTC indicator is required to accurately direct calls in the CSC and work tasks to the
appropriate queue in NFOCUS.
3. Each AD Waiver participant transitioning to UC in a case will receive a speednote explaining the
change in case management. (See the attached script provided below).
4. Renewals will be temporarily assigned to a worker if the renewal results in a VR being sent per
the Assignment of Universal Processing Cases document.
a. When the process is complete, the case will return to UC.

Transfer of Cases
1. Prior to moving the case to UC, during the initial transition, each case will be reviewed to ensure:
a. All alerts are cleared and there is no outstanding work to be completed.
b. Ensure the NFOCUS LTC indicator is set to “On”.
c. Ensure the speednote with approved language is sent.
2. When currently assigned renewals are completed ensure:
a. The NFOCUS LTC indicator is set to “On”.
b. The speednote with approved language is sent.
Intake Cases
1. Cases in the waiver position number will be assigned for review by a worker/supervisor.
2. Cases requiring ongoing assignment will be assigned to a designated worker. Any other case will
be returned to UC.
3. Cases denied/closed for failure to provide (FTP) will remain assigned for 90 days.
4. Cases denied for an eligibility reason will be returned to UC, as a new application will be
required.
5. Intake cases will be assigned per the Assignment of Universal Processing Cases document.
Work Task Queues/ Work Tracking
1. Workers with currently assigned AD waiver cases will be assigned to other work queues as
designated by their administrator. (The assignments may change based on the daily need of the
work queues.)
2. When a worker pulls a “Renewal Not Received alert” from the work queue or in reviewing the
case it is determined the client failed to provide information and a renewal cannot be completed.
The worker will close the case for the come up month taking into consideration 10-day notice.*
a. The worker will remain assigned to the case for 90 days after case closure.
i. If the renewal form is received within 90 days of closure, a new application is not
needed and the worker will proceed with the renewal process.
ii. If the renewal form is not received within 90 days of closure, the assigned worker
will narrate and return the closed case to UC.
*See the State of Emergency guidance for processes related to delayed closings due to the COVID-19
pandemic.
Phone Calls/Emails
1. If the client calls the assigned worker during the transition of cases to UC, the worker should not
transfer calls to the CSC or state the client has to call the CSC for assistance.
a. It is important to inform the customer of the change; however, staff still need to provide
good customer service and answer questions during the transition.
b. Once the worker has assisted the client, explain the change in process and inform the
client of the phone number to contact the CSC the next time they need to call.

c. If a worker receives a complaint call regarding the transition the worker will obtain call
back information and send it to their supervisor.
i. A log has been developed to track the calls and the resolution.
ii. Complaint calls regarding eligibility determinations will be handled per our
normal process.
2. If a client sends an email to the assigned worker and the case is now in UC, take any necessary
action and then reply to the sender with the email script below.
Other Expectations
1. Be flexible, patient, open to adjustments, and provide feedback to your supervisor or
administrator regarding the process.
2. Be positive in your communication with clients, agencies, and other staff.
3. Be committed to making this process work, and provide a high level of service to everyone.
4. Narrate so that The CSC and Local Office staff will have enough documentation to be able to
follow your work and determine what actions were taken on the case. This will allow our agency
to provide accurate and consistent information to customers and move work d efficiently.
