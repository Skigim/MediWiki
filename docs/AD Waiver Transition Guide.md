# AD Waiver Transition Guide

**Document:** Worker Process for Adult In-Home Waiver Cases Transitioning from Assigned to Universal Caseload

---

## Overview

This guide provides procedures for transitioning Adult In-Home waiver cases to Universal Caseload (UC) management.

---

## Initial Implementation

1. Communication was provided to all Area Agency on Aging (AAA) and League of Human Dignity partners statewide by HCBS staff.
2. Effective August 17, 2020, workers with Adult In-Home waiver caseloads will begin transitioning their cases to the Universal Caseload (UC).
3. Workers' voicemail and email signatures will be updated on the effective date to reflect the change in customer service.

## Cases That Will Remain Assigned to Ongoing Workers
1. Spousal Impoverishment (SIMP), cases with ongoing trust dispersals, and other identified cases will remain permanently assigned to the current worker, or designated worker if caseloads are consolidated.
2. Any case in the process of SRT Determination or a resource spend down will remain assigned to the current worker until that process is completed.
3. Cases with an identified resource deprivation should be assigned to a worker from the time the deprivation is discovered until the final amount and penalty period have been determined.
4. Cases where a question has been submitted to the Policy Questions mailbox will remain assigned until the question is answered and any resulting actions have been taken.
5. During this transition, renewals that are past due or due by September 30, 2020 will remain assigned to the current worker. The case will be moved to UC at completion of the renewal.
6. Cases with delayed closing due to the State of Emergency will remain assigned to the current worker until the State of Emergency ends and the case is closed, or until the closing reason is resolved.

## Assigning Cases to Universal Caseload
1. Adult In-Home Waiver cases will move to UC for ongoing case management.
2. NFOCUS LTC indicators must be set to "On" for all cases.
   - Workers will review the indicator at initial application, renewal, or during another transfer to UC.
   - The LTC indicator is required to accurately direct calls in the CSC and work tasks to the appropriate queue in NFOCUS.
3. Each AD Waiver participant transitioning to UC in a case will receive a speednote explaining the change in case management.
4. Renewals will be temporarily assigned to a worker if the renewal results in a VR being sent per the Assignment of Universal Processing Cases document. When the process is complete, the case will return to UC.

## Transfer of Cases
1. Prior to moving the case to UC during the initial transition, each case will be reviewed to ensure:
   - All alerts are cleared and there is no outstanding work to be completed.
   - NFOCUS LTC indicator is set to "On".
   - Speednote with approved language is sent.
2. When currently assigned renewals are completed, ensure:
   - NFOCUS LTC indicator is set to "On".
   - Speednote with approved language is sent.

## Intake Cases
1. Cases in the waiver position number will be assigned for review by a worker/supervisor.
2. Cases requiring ongoing assignment will be assigned to a designated worker. Any other case will be returned to UC.
3. Cases denied/closed for failure to provide (FTP) will remain assigned for 90 days.
4. Cases denied for an eligibility reason will be returned to UC, as a new application will be required.
5. Intake cases will be assigned per the Assignment of Universal Processing Cases document.

## Work Task Queues & Work Tracking
1. Workers with currently assigned AD waiver cases will be assigned to other work queues as designated by their administrator. (The assignments may change based on daily need of the work queues.)
2. When a worker pulls a "Renewal Not Received alert" from the work queue or determines the client failed to provide information and a renewal cannot be completed, the worker will close the case for the come-up month taking into consideration the 10-day notice.
   - The worker will remain assigned to the case for 90 days after case closure.
   - If the renewal form is received within 90 days of closure, a new application is not needed and the worker will proceed with the renewal process.
   - If the renewal form is not received within 90 days of closure, the assigned worker will narrate and return the closed case to UC.

*See the State of Emergency guidance for processes related to delayed closings due to the COVID-19 pandemic.*

## Phone Calls & Emails
1. If the client calls the assigned worker during the transition of cases to UC, the worker should not transfer calls to the CSC or state the client has to call the CSC for assistance.
   - It is important to inform the customer of the change; however, staff still need to provide good customer service and answer questions during the transition.
   - Once the worker has assisted the client, explain the change in process and provide the CSC phone number for future calls.
   - If a worker receives a complaint call regarding the transition, obtain call back information and send it to their supervisor. A log has been developed to track calls and resolutions. Complaint calls regarding eligibility determinations will be handled per normal process.
2. If a client sends an email to the assigned worker and the case is now in UC, take any necessary action and reply to the sender with the email script below.

## Other Expectations
1. Be flexible, patient, open to adjustments, and provide feedback to your supervisor or administrator regarding the process.
2. Be positive in your communication with clients, agencies, and other staff.
3. Be committed to making this process work and provide a high level of service to everyone.
4. Document thoroughly so CSC and Local Office staff have enough information to follow your work and determine what actions were taken on the case. This allows the agency to provide accurate and consistent information to customers and move work efficiently.
