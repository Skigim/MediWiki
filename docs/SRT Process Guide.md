# State Review Team (SRT) / Emergency Medical Services Assistance (EMSA) Process Guide

**State Review Team & Emergency Medical Services Assistance**  
*Comprehensive guide to disability determinations and EMSA procedures*

---

## Overview

All applicants for Aid to the Blind or Aid to the Disabled after January 1, 1974 must meet the medical definitions of blindness or disability of the RSDI/SSI Programs as administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA). The determination by SSA that an individual is disabled or blind must be accepted for eligibility for AABD/MA (Non-MAGI). In some cases, the State Review Team (SRT) may make the determination of blindness or disability (477 NAC 27-002.02(C)(ii)).

**Effective 10/1/2020:** Individuals age 19-64 may qualify for HHA MAGI Medicaid. Prior to referring these individuals to State Review Team, a budget must be considered for HHA. If an individual is not eligible for HHA and meets one of the conditions for Direct Referral to State Review Team, a referral may be considered.

SRT cases are returned to the Universal system once the case has either been approved or denied. In some instances, the Universal worker may need to process the SRT request. Additionally, there may be a temporary dual assignment between an SRT worker and an Assigned worker if the case is specialized (e.g. NH/AL, MIWD).

## Key Definitions

**State Review Team (SRT)**: State-level disability determination process used when SSA cannot or will not make a disability decision for Medicaid eligibility purposes.

**Emergency Medical Services Assistance (EMSA)**: Medicaid coverage for undocumented individuals with emergency medical conditions who would otherwise be eligible except for immigration status.

**Direct Referral**: Cases that bypass SSA and go directly to SRT for disability determination due to specific circumstances (income/resources exceed SSI limits, institutionalization, etc.).

**Catastrophic Medical Event**: Significant medical occurrence (cancer diagnosis, stroke, etc.) that may warrant SRT referral following a previous "lack of severity" SSI denial.

**State Disability Program (SDP)**: Time-limited state-funded program (maximum 12 months) for individuals denied SSI due to "lack of duration."

**MLTC-73**: Nebraska State Review Team Determination form documenting SRT approval, review dates, and disability period.

**Lack of Severity**: SSI denial reason indicating impairment does not meet severity criteria; does not automatically qualify for SRT referral without catastrophic medical event.

**Lack of Duration**: SSI denial reason indicating impairment not expected to last 12+ months; individual may qualify for SDP but not Medicaid.

---

## Direct Referral Criteria

### Universal Staff Processes - Handling an Initial Request

**Step 1: Review Application**
- Application for Medicaid received by MLTC
- Review application to determine if SRT referral is appropriate
- Electronic application question: "Is there anything else you would like to tell us about your household's situation"
- Obtain supplemental application if needed
- Assign to Non-MAGI queue

**Step 2: Make Referral to SRT Position Number 75013343 if:**

Individual is **not eligible for another assistance program** AND **any** of the following conditions apply:

#### Direct Referral to State Review Team (477 NAC 27-002.02(C)(ii)(2))

1. **Income and/or resources exceed SSI Program limits**

2. **Immediate long-term hospitalization required** - Individual requires immediate long-term hospitalization and/or treatment for severe impairment before SSI can make determination, or would be required to extend hospital stay solely because of delay in processing SSI (e.g., cancer, stroke)
   - **NOTE:** Does not include need for routine medication, diagnostic tests, or drug/alcohol treatment

3. **Institutionalized** - Individual is in nursing home or public institution and SSI will be unable to make determination

4. **Deceased** - Individual is deceased and SSI will not make disability decision

5. **Non-U.S. citizen** - Individual is non-U.S. citizen and SSI will not review

#### Catastrophic Medical Event

6. **"Lack of Severity" denial within previous 12 months AND Catastrophic Medical Event** has occurred since SSI denial
   - **NOTE:** Critical thinking skills should be applied to determine what qualifies as "Catastrophic Medical Event" - consult Supervisor if questions

#### State Disability Program (SDP) Closure

7. **SDP has been open for 12 months, closing, SSI remains denied due to "lack of duration"**, and application/supplemental application received by MLTC
   - Review to determine if individual has appealed SSI denial
   - **If yes:** Follow MLTC SRT referral process (Step 2f below)
   - **If no:** Deny using reason "Eligibility Requirements Not Met," send notice, document actions

#### Emergency Medical Services Assistance (EMSA) Referrals

8. **EMSA referrals** should be made for undocumented individuals with dependents, undocumented children, and undocumented single adults **only if they would meet SSA's disability criteria**

For EMSA, individual must meet a category of eligibility and would have been eligible for Medicaid, except for immigration status.

**Review application for the following eligibility factors:**

**A. Citizenship/Immigration Status:**
- Attempt to call individual to obtain additional information if unable to determine immigration status from application
- Submit US Citizenship and Immigration request (VLP or SAVE) prior to submitting referral
- Follow procedures in MLTC Citizenship and Immigration Guide to determine if individual is Lawfully Present

**B. Emergency Medical Condition** - Medical condition (including emergency labor and delivery) manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) where absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably result in:
- Serious jeopardy to patient's health
- Serious impairment to bodily functions
- Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part

**NOTE:** General labor/delivery requests are NOT to be referred to SRT position number and should be reviewed, approved, and processed by Universal Workers

**Verification Steps:**
- Review electronic application question: "Is there anything else you would like to tell us about your household's situation"
- Review Document Imaging for medical information sent at time of application
- Attempt to call individual and obtain information to determine if there is Emergency Medical Condition (if no indication on application or in Document Imaging)

**If Emergency Medical Condition confirmed:**
- Refer to SRT position number if individual meets category of eligibility but does not have immigration status meeting Medicaid regulations, AND has Emergency Medical Condition meeting definition above

**If Emergency Medical Condition NOT confirmed:**
- Deny using reason: "Eligibility Requirements Not Met" or "Ineligible Alien"
- Send notice
- Document actions

#### Immigration Status Time Limit

9. **Individuals whose SSI ended due to reaching maximum number of years (7)** but have not reached certain immigration status within that time period
   - Verified by SDX alert: "Nonpay – Not a U.S. citizen or eligible alien – N13"

**Step 2f: Assignment Process**
- Assign to EMSA/SRT position number **75013343**
- Should case inadvertently be denied or closed prior to placing on EMSA/SRT position number, send E-Mail to: Kathy Fiorelli, Marnie Carr, Terra Meyer, Rebecca McDonald, Nikki Adrian, and Tonya Kramer (this position is on rotation)

## When NOT to Refer to SRT

**DO NOT make referral to SRT position number if any of the following conditions apply:**

### 599 CHIP Program Appropriate

**Undocumented pregnant woman applies in month of birth** (even if child was born prior to application being filed) - Process as 599 CHIP
- If undocumented pregnant woman applies month **after** baby was born, refer to SRT position number for EMSA determination
- Follow Presumptive Eligibility workaround on pages 5-6 of 599 CHIP Process Guide if child was "birthed" prior to processing 599 CHIP

### Qualified Immigration Status

**Individual has qualified immigration status and has met 5-year bar**
- Process as regular Medicaid

### SSI Denied Due to "Lack of Severity"

**Denial within previous 12 months AND no Catastrophic Medical Event:**
- **NOTE:** Critical thinking skills should be applied to determine what qualifies as "Catastrophic Medical Event" - consult Supervisor if questions
- **Action:** Deny Medicaid using reason "Not disabled or blind," send notice, document actions

**Denial has been over 12 months:**
- Request additional information from applicant to determine if SRT referral is appropriate

### SSI Denied Due to "Lack of Duration"

**Action:**
- Deny Medicaid using reason "Eligibility Requirements Not Met" (NOTE: SDP is NOT a Medicaid Program)
- Send notice with added comments informing individual they may be eligible for State Disability Program and need to apply through Economic Assistance

**Suggested Comment Template:**
> "Your SSI was denied for reason of 'lack of duration'. This is not an eligible Medicaid program reason. You may be eligible for the State Disability Program and should apply through Economic Assistance. For questions, please call the Economic Assistance Customer Service Center at 1-800-383-4278."

## SRT Renewal Process

### Handling a SRT Renewal

**Step 1: "Medical Review Due" Alert Received**

**A. Review Interfaces (BDE/SDX)**
- Verify if individual has been determined eligible by SSA
- **If yes:**
  1. Review Medical Impairment Task in Expert
  2. End date the SRT Blind, SRT Disabled, or SRT Medical Services Assistance determination
  3. Process as Non-MAGI and DO NOT refer to SRT position number

**B. Review Age**
- Determine if individual has turned age 65 since last SRT determination
- **If yes:** Process as Non-MAGI and DO NOT refer to SRT position number

**C. Review for Ineligibility Factors**
- Determine if there are any changes that would result in ineligibility or case closure (e.g., EA narrative verifies individual moved out of state)
- **If yes:** Close case and DO NOT refer to SRT position number

**D. Review for "Permanent" Disability Approvals**
- Review MLTC-73 and Medical Impairment Module to determine if individual has been approved for "Permanent" disability (no disability end date)
- **NOTE:** Permanent disability determinations cannot be honored as State does not have authority to determine individuals "permanently" disabled

**If staff discover previous SRT "Permanent" disability approval (no end date):**
1. Review interfaces to determine if individual has been approved for Social Security or SSI
2. Set alert:
   - **Display Date:** 60 days prior to renewal due date (Example: SRT renewal due 3-31-17; alert "Display Date" should be entered as 2-1-17)
   - **Alert Description:** Refer to SRT
   - **Content of Alert:** SRT review needed as individual has been approved for "Permanent Disability"
3. Document that case should be sent to SRT at time of renewal

**E. New Disability Determination Needed**
- If none of above conditions met and new disability determination needed:
  - Assign to EMSA/SRT position number **75013343**
