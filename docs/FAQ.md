### Adding SSI Income

**Q: What do I need to do after adding SSI income to Expert?**

**A:** After adding SSI to Expert, you must go back in and add **SSI/FBR** (Federal Benefit Rate) afterward.

**Steps:**
1. Add initial SSI income entry in Expert
2. Return to income section
3. Add second entry for **SSI/FBR**
4. **Value**: Use the Federal Benefit Rate from the **MLTC Program Standards Chart**
5. **Claim Number**: Use the same **Social Security Number** for both SSI and SSI/FBR entries
6. **Keep the case assigned** to yourself
7. **Set an alert for 21 days**
8. **After 21 days**: Check if SSI has interfaced automatically
   - If SSI interfaced automatically: **Close the manual entry**
   - If SSI has not interfaced: Keep manual entry and follow up

**Why?** The Federal Benefit Rate must be tracked separately for proper budget calculations. SSI typically interfaces automatically within 21 days through SDX/BDE, at which point the manual entry should be removed to avoid duplication.

**Reference**: MLTC Program Standards Chart (for current FBR values)
