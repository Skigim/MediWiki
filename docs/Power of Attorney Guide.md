## Financial Power of Attorney

Financial Power of Attorney, sometimes referred to as a **durable power of attorney**, gives the attorney-in-fact the authority to manage an individual's financial affairs should they become incapacitated.

A Financial Power of Attorney typically authorizes the attorney-in-fact to:

- Pay bills, including signing checks
- Buy, sell, and manage real estate
- Handle legal matters
- File tax returns
- Conduct business transactions
- Make medical decisions (dependent on authorities specified)

### Scope of Authority

There may be additional duties allowed by the POA, depending on whether the authority granted is **general or limited**. Such limitations are usually outlined in the legal language of the POA document.

This authority **may or may not include healthcare decisions**. A financial power of attorney has a duty to work with the healthcare power of attorney in assisting the individual.

### Duration

POA expires upon the death of the individual.

## Application to Medicaid

### Valid for Medicaid Applications

**Both types of Power of Attorney are considered valid and can be accepted for Medicaid applications:**

- Financial Power of Attorney ✓
- Healthcare Power of Attorney ✓

Either type of POA holder may sign and submit a Medicaid application on behalf of an incapacitated individual.

## AVS Consent Requirements

### AVS Consent Authority

> ⚠️ **Important:** Because the authority to make financial decisions is not generally included in the language of the healthcare POA paperwork, **a Healthcare Power of Attorney is not valid for AVS consent.**

| POA Type | Valid for Medicaid Application | Valid for AVS Consent |
|----------|-------------------------------|----------------------|
| Financial POA | ✓ Yes | ✓ Yes |
| Healthcare POA | ✓ Yes | ✗ No |

When processing AVS consent, verify that the individual providing consent has a **Financial Power of Attorney** that specifically grants authority to access financial information.

---

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Both Valid for Applications:** Either Financial or Healthcare POA can be used to sign Medicaid applications

✓ **AVS Requires Financial POA:** Only Financial Power of Attorney is valid for AVS consent because it involves accessing financial information

✓ **Review POA Language:** Always review the specific authorities granted in the POA document, as they may be general or limited

✓ **POA Expires at Death:** All Power of Attorney authority ends upon the death of the principal

✓ **Financial POA Works with Healthcare POA:** A financial power of attorney has a duty to work with the healthcare power of attorney in assisting the individual
