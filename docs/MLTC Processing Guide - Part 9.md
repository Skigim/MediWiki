**Pages 41-42: Position Numbers, Failed to Provide, Renewals Overview**

---

## MEDICAID POSITION NUMBERS FOR CASE ASSIGNMENTS

• All referrals to a position number for assignment must be narrated. The narrative must include the reason for the referral. Application Managers do not need to narrate unless there are special circumstances.

• All position numbers must be cleared daily and cases assigned within two business days.

• See [Medicaid Position Numbers for Case Assignments](Medicaid%20Position%20Numbers%20for%20Case%20Assignments.md).

## APPLICATION DENIED FOR "FAILED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION"

• If an application is being denied for "Failed to Provide Information", comments may be included on the Notice as to what information is still missing on the case and the timeframe the individual has to provide before a new application is necessary (90 days from application date).

- **477 NAC 3-005.06 – NEW APPLICATION:** A new application is required after 90 days of ineligibility.
- Use the Calculator for Days 30, 45, 60 and 90 for help in calculating the correct date and see Is a New Application Needed for further information.

**If an application was denied for "Failed to Provide Information" and the applicant has turned in verifications within 90 days of the application date:**

Determine if all requested verifications were turned in. See [Changes Reported During 90 Day Redetermination Period](Changes%20Reported%20During%2090%20Day%20Redetermination%20Period.md) for further information.

**If all necessary verifications were received:**
- Close the VR and re-pend and process the case from the application month
- Review the application to determine if there was retroactive Medicaid requested. Remember to process the retroactive months as well as application month forward if all verifications have been provided. See the [Retroactive Medicaid Process](Retroactive%20Medicaid%20Process.md) for further information
- If you cannot process the retroactive months but can process from application month forward, notify applicant of how many days they have left to provide verifications for the retroactive months, and what verifications are still needed. **Do not pend the retroactive months until an eligibility determination can be made (eligible or ineligible).**

**If all necessary verifications were not received:**
- Do not re-pend the case
- Send a speednote stating what information is still needed on the case and the timeframe the HH has to provide information before a new application is necessary (90 days from application date)
