## Overview

Retroactive (retro) Medicaid is coverage provided for up to three (3) months prior to an applicant's initial application date. Retro Medicaid can be requested at any time within 6 months of the initial application date, even if there was no indication of need for retro Medicaid on the application or renewal form. The individual has 6 months from the initial application date to provide required verification and have retro Medicaid eligibility determined.

## Important Reminders About Retroactive Medicaid

### Request Timing

✓ Retro Medicaid can be requested on an application or renewal form, on a Change Report submitted by the individual, or verbally via a phone call

✓ Retro Medicaid can be requested any time within **6 months** of the initial application date

### Program Case Handling

✓ A retro Medicaid Program case will **not be pended** in NFOCUS until an eligibility determination can be completed (approval or denial)

### Verification Requests

✓ Staff **no longer need to create a separate VR** for retro when requesting information for retro and prospective eligibility at the same time

See [Verification Requests Section](#verification-requests-vrs-for-retro-medicaid) for detailed procedures.

**Resources**:
- Policy Memo 25-02: Verification Request Due Date for Initial Applications
- Policy Memo 25-02 Supplemental Guide
- Date Calculator

### Suggested VR Wording

> "Retroactive Medicaid has been requested for (name) for the months of (list months). In order to determine your eligibility for Retroactive Medicaid, please provide the following verifications: (list verifications needed to process)."

### Administrative Roles

✓ Remember to add administrative roles (e.g., Authorized Representative, Guardian, or Power of Attorney) to the separate retro Medicaid program case

**When retro Medicaid program case is pended**:
- Staff must review and include any administrative roles from the pending or active Medicaid case
- If the role is not added, the case representative will not receive correspondence about the retro case

### Notice Requirement

✓ Once eligibility for retro Medicaid has been determined, it is **required** that the individual and administrative role(s) receive a Notice of Action for the retro months

See the [Pending and Processing](#pending-and-processing-retro-requests) and [Notice of Action](#notice-of-action-noa) sections below.

### Program Exclusions

✗ There is **no retro Medicaid eligibility** for 599 CHIP

✗ For newborns, there is **no eligibility** for any months prior to their birth month

**Follow-Up**: If retro is being requested for a newborn for months prior to the birth month and the mother is not active or requesting Medicaid, follow up may be needed to determine if the mother is requesting labor and delivery coverage. If so, an application is needed for the mother.

### Continuous Eligibility Consideration

✓ If retro Medicaid eligibility is for a child or otherwise CE individual (PW - pregnant woman), continuous eligibility may be considered from the first month of eligibility in retro **if there is no prospective eligibility**

See the [Continuous Eligibility Guide](Continuous%20Eligibility%20Guide.md) for further information.

## Retroactive Medicaid Requests

### 6-Month Request and Verification Period

The individual is allowed **6 months from the date of application** to:
- Request retro Medicaid
- Provide required verification(s)

**Important**: The worker will only review retro Medicaid eligibility for the months that were requested. If the individual only requested 1 month out of the 3 possible months, only the 1 month can be considered.

### Example 1: Request on Application - Information Not Provided

**Application received**: January 14, 2025  
**Retro requested for**: October, November, and December 2024  
**VR sent**: Information unable to be verified through electronic sources  
**VR not returned**: By the due date

**Process**:
1. Pend retro Medicaid request
2. Deny for "Failed to Provide Information"
3. Send notice of action
4. Individual has **until July 13, 2025** (6 months from January 14) to provide verifications

**Result**: If verifications are provided on or before July 13, 2025, the retro Medicaid request must be processed.

### Example 2: Later Request - Information Not Provided

**Application received**: January 21, 2025 (no retro requested)  
**Retro requested later**: March 1, 2025  
**VR sent**: Information unable to be verified  
**VR not returned**: By the due date

**Process**:
1. Pend retro Medicaid request
2. Deny for "Failed to Provide Information"
3. Send notice of action
4. Individual has **until July 20, 2025** (6 months from January 21 application date) to provide verifications

**Result**: If verifications are provided on or before July 20, 2025, the retro Medicaid request must be processed.

### Example 3: Request Near End of 6-Month Period

**Application received**: January 1, 2025  
**Retro requested**: June 25, 2025 (prior to 6-month timeframe)  
**VR sent**: Information unable to be verified  
**VR not returned**: By the due date

**Process**:
1. Pend retro Medicaid request
2. Deny for "Failed to Provide Information"
3. Send notice of action

**Result**: The individual would **not have a redetermination period** to provide necessary information, unlike Examples 1 and 2 above. The reason for not allowing more time is the request for retro Medicaid was received near the end of the 6 months. If information is received after the VR due date, the retro Medicaid request **cannot be processed**.

### Previously Denied Applications

**Note**: Retro Medicaid can still be requested on a previously denied initial application if it is within the 6-month timeframe from when the application was submitted. The determination for ongoing eligibility does not impact the agency's ability to review retro Medicaid.

## Income for Retroactive Medicaid

### Earned Income

#### Use Same Verification as Prospective

Determine if an electronic data source is available and it is reasonably compatible with the attested income. If the employment in the requested retro month(s) is the same as the current employment the individual attested to on the application and it's verified using electronic data sources, **use the same income information** for retro Medicaid months and the ongoing eligibility.

**Applies to both MAGI and Non-MAGI**: This process is used regardless of when the retro Medicaid request was made.

**Policy References**:
- 477 NAC 22-002.03(A) - Non-MAGI
- 477 NAC 16-001.14 - MAGI

#### SEW (State Employer Wage)

The SEW interface can be used for **both MAGI and Non-MAGI categories** (except for Share of Cost) if it is reasonably compatible.

See **Policy Memo - SEW** for additional information.

**Non-MAGI Share of Cost (SOC) Exception**: For SOC, **actual income must be used** because SEW variances month to month could affect the SOC obligation (477 NAC 22-002.03(A)).

#### Tax/Hub (MAGI Only)

Unless the household has indicated that the income source is new, the Tax/Hub must be used as the first verification source.

**If Tax/Hub verified income at initial application**: Use the Tax/Hub for the retro months as well.

**For retro request made post-application**: Review the Tax/Hub information that was completed at the time the initial application was processed. If the Tax/Hub verified the income at initial application, use the Tax/Hub for the retro request. If Tax/Hub did not verify income, **do not submit for new Tax/Hub information** - move to the next verification source.

**Tax/Hub Example**:  
Initial application received April 2, 2025, requesting retro Medicaid for January, February, and March 2025. Attested income is from McDonald's with no indication that the income is new or that there has been a change. The attested monthly income is verified by the Tax/Hub for ongoing months. As such, the attested income must also be used in the retro budgets with the Tax/Hub as the verification source.

#### VCI/TALX

**Actual gross income must be used** for each retroactive month.

If a lead shows that the income may need to be annualized, additional follow-up would be required because income should also be annualized for retro budgets.

**Reminder**: Non-MAGI does not annualize earned income.

#### SEW Verification

Compare the attested income to the most recent SEW quarter. The most recent SEW quarter can be used even if the retro months being budgeted do not fall within the SEW quarter.

**SEW Example**:  
Initial application received May 2nd, requesting retro for February, March, and April. When SEW is reviewed, use the first quarter if available and reasonably compatible with attested income. If the first quarter is not available, review the fourth quarter from the previous year. If reasonably compatible, the fourth quarter from the previous year can be used as the verification source.

If a lead shows that the income may need to be annualized, additional follow-up would be required because income should also be annualized for retro budgets.

**Reminder**: Non-MAGI does not annualize earned income.

#### Paper Verification

Actual gross income must be used for each retro month if electronic verification is not successful.

**If unable to obtain information via call out**:
- Generate a VR for actual gross income for each retro month requested

**Self-Employment**:
- If a tax return is provided and determined reflective, the pro-rated annualized amount must be used in the retro budgets
- If self-employment ledgers are provided, the actual amounts must be used for each of the retro Medicaid budgets

### Unearned Income

Follow Nebraska's 477-000-004 - Verification Plan/Verification and Document Guide.

Electronic data sources (e.g., [BDE](BDE%20Process%20Guide.md), [SDX](SDX%20Guide.md), IUC) are the first verification source for unearned income.

**If unable to verify via electronic data sources**:
- Attempt a call out to the source of income (e.g., Social Security Administration, Veteran's Administration hotline, retirement companies) for actual gross income
- If unable to obtain all required information from the source of income, send a VR to provide actual gross income for each retro month requested

## Deductions for Retroactive Medicaid

### MAGI Deductions

To determine allowable MAGI deductions, refer to:
- MAGI Deduction Guide
- WINK-ed MAGI Income Deductions
- Deductions section of the MLTC Processing Guide

### Non-MAGI Deductions

To determine allowable Non-MAGI deductions, refer to:
- Appendix 477-000-026 - Basic Budgetary Allowance for Non-MAGI
- Deductions section of the MLTC Processing Guide

### Calculation Method Must Match Income

**Critical Rule**: The calculation of the deductions must match the calculation method used for the income in the retroactive months.

If a retroactive budget is approved using paystubs with **"Actual Only"** as the calculation method, deductions must match the actual amounts from those paychecks **without converting them to a monthly amount**.

### Deduction Example

Paystubs from 2/7 and 2/21 are received for an individual who is paid on a bi-weekly basis. The paystubs report allowable deductions:
- 2/7 paycheck: $50 deduction
- 2/21 paycheck: $100 deduction

**Correct Deduction Amount for February 2025**: $150 (the actual amount from both paystubs)

**Incorrect**: Do NOT use the average/converted amount of $161.25 ($150/2 = $75 x 2.15 = $161.25)

---

## Resources for Retroactive Medicaid (Non-MAGI Only)

To determine retro eligibility for a Non-MAGI individual, **verify all countable resources** and document on the case.

### AVS Verification

Follow the Medicaid Resource Verification Plan and [AVS Procedural Guide](AVS%20Procedural%20Guide.md).

**AVS should have been requested** at the time the initial application was received. AVS results will need to be reviewed.

### Actual Account Balances Required

**Actual account balances are needed for each retro month requested.**

### Reduction of Resources

Reduction of Resources can be used for excess resources and spent down on medical bills to obtain retro.

**Requirements**:
- Can only be done if the individual has unpaid medical bills
- Individual must be requesting medical assistance for the three (3) months prior to the initial application month (retroactive period)
- The individual should pay the oldest medical bills in the retroactive period first

See Appendix 477-000-034 - Resource Spend-Down

---

## Verification Requests (VRs) for Retro Medicaid

Verification Request due dates may be **15 days** or **30 days**, dependent upon whether the individual has established Medicaid eligibility.

### VR Management Note

If marking VR items as received would close the entire VR but further information is still needed for retro or prospective month, **don't mark the VR items** and narrate the items that were received and what remains outstanding.

### 15-Day VRs

Used when prospective/ongoing eligibility has been **denied** or has **not yet been determined**.

#### Retro Request After Prospective Denial

If prospective eligibility was denied but the individual requested retroactive Medicaid on the application or later requests retro and a VR needs to be sent for information needed to determine retroactive Medicaid eligibility, this VR due date must be set for **15 days**.

**CE Consideration**: If retro Medicaid is for a child or otherwise CE individual (PW), continuous eligibility may be considered from the first month of eligibility if there is no prospective eligibility. See the [Continuous Eligibility Guide](Continuous%20Eligibility%20Guide.md).

#### Combined Prospective and Retro VRs

If verifications are needed at the same time for a prospective and retroactive Medicaid request, **one VR must be created**. The one VR must include all necessary verification for initial eligibility and retro eligibility. The VR due date must be set to **15 days**.

**If information not provided for both**:
- Leave the VRs open
- Deny the initial eligibility and retro eligibility
- Notice should include language for the 90-day redetermination period for the initial application and the 6-month timeframe for the retro eligibility request

**If information provided for initial but not retro**:
- Mark the VR items that were received
- Do not close the VR
- The VR will be left open for the 6-month retro eligibility timeframe
- Process the initial eligibility request and deny the retro eligibility request
- The individual has 6 months from the initial application date to provide required verification
- If a worker identifies a VR that was left open for a retro request and it is past 6 months from the initial application date, the VR can be closed

**If information provided for retro but not initial**:
- Mark the VR items that were received
- Do not close the VR
- Process the retro eligibility
- Take appropriate action on the initial eligibility request
- If retro Medicaid is for a child or otherwise CE individual (PW), continuous eligibility may be considered from the first month of eligibility if there is no prospective eligibility

### 30-Day VRs

Used when an individual has been **approved for prospective/ongoing eligibility**.

#### Retro Request on Application - Prospective Approved

If the individual has requested retroactive Medicaid on the initial application, but verifications are only needed for retroactive Medicaid requests because prospective eligibility has been approved, a VR must be created to request information for a retroactive Medicaid determination. This VR due date must be set to **30 days**.

#### Retro Request After Prospective Approval

If the individual did not request retroactive Medicaid on the initial application but later requests retroactive Medicaid after application month was approved, a VR must be sent for information for a retroactive Medicaid determination. This VR due date must be **30 days**.

---

## Pending and Processing Retro Requests

### Partial Month Processing

If 3 months of retro Medicaid are requested and verification is received for only 1 or 2 of the months, the worker can **process the months where all verifications have been received**. The months with missing verifications would be denied.

**CE Consideration**: If retro Medicaid eligibility is for a child or otherwise CE individual (PW), continuous eligibility may be considered from the first month of eligibility if there is no prospective eligibility. See the [Continuous Eligibility Guide](Continuous%20Eligibility%20Guide.md).

### If All Verifications Are on File

**Process**:
1. Pend the Retro MED Program Case
2. Add any administrative roles to the Retro MED Program Case
3. Run budgets for all retro months requested in order to determine eligibility
   - If the attested income is over the FPL, pend the case, enter the information into NFOCUS Expert to allow NFOCUS to determine eligibility, deny for Over Income and create a notice
4. Send notice to the individual(s) and administrative role(s)

### NFOCUS System Limitations

In situations where NFOCUS does not allow a participant to be pended for a retro month, **document in the narrative and send a generic notice**. The worker must enter the appropriate NAC regulation that is applicable to the correct approval or denial reason.

See the [Notice of Action (NOA)](#notice-of-action-noa) section below for additional information.

### If VR Not Received by Due Date

**Process**:
1. Pend the Retro MED Program Case
2. Add any administrative roles to the Retro MED Program Case
3. Manually deny the Retro MED Program Case for "Failed to Provide Information" (FTP) and send a notice
   - This should only be done after the VR Due alert has been received

**If denied due to FTP**: Eligibility for retro may still be determined any time within 6 months from the initial application date.
- A new application is not necessary as long as the verifications are provided within the 6-month timeframe from the application date
- The initial VR for retro can be resent to the individual if needed

### If Retro Request is Withdrawn

**Process**:
1. Pend the Retro MED Program Case
2. Add any administrative roles to the Retro MED Program Case
3. Manually deny the Retro MED Program Case for "Client Request" and send a notice

### If Ineligible Retro Month Requested

**Example**: Application received in July and retro is requested for January, which is outside of the eligible 3 retro months.

**Process**:
- A Retro MED Program Case **does not need to be pended and denied** if the only month requested is a month which is ineligible for retro
- Attempt a call out of the HH to verbally inform them they requested an ineligible month
- If the PC attempt is unsuccessful, send a Generic Notice informing the applicant that they requested an ineligible retro month. Include the manual reference for Retro MED.

---

## Notice of Action (NOA)

### Generate and Review NOA

**Standard NOA Process**:
- Generate and review NOA
- If denying for the reason of "Failed to Provide Information", staff may add comments to the NOA explaining what information is still required and the timeframe to provide
- Review that the NOA is also being sent to the administrative role if one has been designated

### Special Situations Requiring Generic Notices

For retro Medicaid requests where regulation does not allow for a Medicaid determination or the Retro MED Program Case is otherwise unable to be pended or run, the individual must still be informed of their eligibility.

#### 599 CHIP - Not Allowable

Retro Medicaid is **not allowable** for the 599 CHIP Medicaid category.

**Process**:
- If the request is indicated on the initial application or made post eligibility, the worker must pend and deny eligibility for the retro request for the pregnant woman using the applicable reason (e.g., Ineligible Alien) and send an NOA

See the 599 CHIP Process Guide for additional information.

#### Eligibility Requirement Not Met

Retro Medicaid request for months that an eligibility requirement is not met (e.g., residency or prior to date of birth).

**Process**:
- If the request is indicated on the initial application or made post eligibility, the worker must pend and deny the eligibility for the retro request using the applicable reason and send an NOA

**Example**: An application is received on 09/20/2024 requesting retro Medicaid. Information on the case verifies that the applicants moved to Nebraska on 09/08/2024. The HH is ineligible for any retro months due to not being considered Nebraska residents. The retro case would be pended and the individuals denied for Residency for each retro month. A system-generated notice would be sent with the NAC references.

#### System Does Not Allow Pend

Instances where the system does not allow a retro case to be pended (e.g., prior to the date of birth or the individual was already active in retro months).

**Process**:
- If the request is indicated on the initial application, add an explanation to the comment section of the initial eligibility Notice of Action
- If the request is made post eligibility, send a Generic Notice to the individual informing them of their retro eligibility
- NAC references must be included on the NOA or Generic Notice

**Example**: A retro request is being made for a child prior to their birth month. A Generic Notice would be sent indicating that the newborn is not eligible for the months prior to their birth. NAC references for age requirements and age limits for Medicaid (477 NAC 7-001) would be included on the Generic Notice.
