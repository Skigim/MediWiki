## Change Management Process

### When Cases Are Closed for Failed to Provide Information

When an active case has been closed because the individual failed to provide requested information, and the individual later provides that information along with a new reported change, workers must follow a specific process.

#### Step 1: Verify the Reported Change

Workers should attempt to verify the reported change using the following methods in order:

1. **Electronic Data Sources**: Check VCI/TALX, SEW, and other available systems
2. **Phone Call-Out**: Attempt to verify information by contacting the employer or source
3. **Verification Request**: If electronic and phone verification fail, send a VR form

#### Step 2: Reopen the Case

If the individual provides the previously requested information and the newly reported change cannot be verified:

- **Reopen the case immediately** before the change is verified
- The agency must give the individual the opportunity to provide verification of the new change
- **Eligibility cannot be delayed** pending verification of the new change
- NFOCUS will retain the individual's previous Expiry Date
- Workers must review and correct the Expiry Date if the system sets it incorrectly

#### Notice Requirements

- Send an Approval notice when reopening the case
- **Do not include renewal language** if it is not the individual's renewal period or if the renewal cannot be completed

### Change Management Example #1

**Scenario**: Case closed 11/1/2024 for failure to verify Runza income. Next Expiry Date: 3/31/2025. On 12/7/2024, worker receives alerts for mail received and new hire information. Individual provided Runza verification but now has new hire alert for Pizza Hut. Electronic and phone verification unsuccessful.

**Required Actions**:
- Reopen the case and reinstate eligibility beginning 11/1/2024
- Send VR and EIV form to verify Pizza Hut income
- Eligibility cannot be delayed pending verification
- Ensure existing Expiry Date (3/31/2025) is retained
- Send approval notice without renewal language

### Change Management Example #2

**Scenario**: Case scheduled to close 1/1/2025 for failure to verify McDonald's income. Next Expiry Date: 6/30/2025. On 12/20/2024, worker receives mail received alert. Individual provided McDonald's verification but reported new employment with Jalisco's. Electronic and phone verification unsuccessful.

**Required Actions**:
- Reopen the case and reinstate eligibility effective 1/1/2025
- Send VR and EIV form to verify Jalisco's income
- Eligibility cannot be delayed pending verification
- Ensure existing Expiry Date (6/30/2025) is retained
- Send approval notice without renewal language

## Renewal Process

### When Cases Are Closed During Renewal Period

When an active case has been closed during the renewal for "Failed to Provide Information" or "Case Review Not Completed," and the individual provides requested information (including renewal form as necessary) along with a new reported change.

#### Step 1: Verify the Reported Change

Follow the same verification hierarchy as Change Management:

1. Electronic data sources (VCI/TALX, SEW)
2. Phone call-out attempt
3. Send Verification Request if needed

#### Step 2: Reopen the Case

If the individual provides previously requested information and the newly reported change cannot be verified:

- If a renewal form was previously sent and not provided, **the case must remain closed** until a renewal form is provided
- If all previously requested information is provided, reopen/reinstate eligibility
- The agency must give the individual the opportunity to provide verification of the new change
- **Eligibility cannot be delayed** pending verification

#### Step 3: Handle the Incomplete Renewal

When the newly reported change cannot be verified during the renewal period and the case is reopened, the renewal is **NOT considered processed**.

**Required Actions**:

1. **Use the Delay Renewal button** on individuals being reopened where renewal cannot be completed
   - This prevents Expiry Date updates
   - This prevents renewal notice generation

2. **Verify Expiry Date**
   - NFOCUS retains the previous Expiry Date
   - Review for accuracy and correct if system set it incorrectly

3. **Set Processing Mode**
   - Set case for Processing mode unless it is assigned

4. **Document in Narratives**
   - Must narrate that the renewal was not completed
   - Include information that if new verifications are provided:
     - The renewal must be processed
     - The Expiry Date must be updated
     - A renewal notice must be sent

#### Step 4: Process Verification When Received

When verification of the new change is provided:

**If Individual Remains Eligible**:
- The renewal is considered successfully completed
- Update the Expiry Date to the correct date
- Send a renewal notice

**If New Change Makes Individual Ineligible** (e.g., Over Income):
- The renewal is not considered completed
- Process the case and close with appropriate reason
- Send a closure notice
- Do not update the Expiry Date

**If Verification Not Provided by VR Due Date**:
- The renewal is not considered completed
- Close the individual for "Failed to Provide Information"
- Send a closure notice
- Do not update the Expiry Date

### Renewal Example

**Scenario**: Expiry Date 8/31/2024. Worker 1 attempts Desk Review on 7/15/2024 but cannot verify Target income electronically or by phone. Sends VR, EIV, and renewal form. Information not provided by due date, so participant closed effective 9/1/2024. On 9/12/2024, Worker 1 receives renewal form and Target verification, but renewal form also reports new Scooters Coffee employment. Unable to verify Scooters Coffee income.

**Required Actions**:

1. **Reopen the case effective 9/1/2024**
   - Use the Delay Renewal button to prevent renewal processing
   - This prevents Expiry Date update and renewal notice

2. **Send VR and EIV form** for Scooters Coffee income
   - Eligibility cannot be delayed pending verification
   - The renewal is not considered completed

3. **Send approval notices** without renewal language

4. **Verify Expiry Date**
   - NFOCUS retains previous Expiry Date of 08/31/2024
   - This is correct; do not change at this stage

5. **Add clear narratives** for next worker:
   - Renewal was not completed
   - Expiry Date needs to be updated to 8/31/2025 when renewal is processed

6. **When Scooters verification is received** (Worker 2):
   - Add income to budget
   - Process the renewal
   - Update Expiry Date based on original renewal cycle (8/31/2025)
   - Send the renewal notice

## Verification Steps

### Electronic Verification Hierarchy

Workers must attempt verification in this order:

1. **VCI/TALX**: The Work Number database for employment and income verification
2. **SEW (State Eligibility Wage)**: State wage database
3. **Phone Call-Out**: Direct contact with employer or information source
4. **Verification Request**: Form sent to client when other methods unsuccessful

### Verification Request Requirements

When electronic and phone verification attempts fail:

- Send VR (Verification Request) form to the client
- Send EIV (Employment Income Verification) form for employment-related changes
- Set appropriate due date for verification submission
- Document all verification attempts in case narratives

---

## Expiry Date Management

### NFOCUS Automatic Behavior

When reopening a case after closure:

- NFOCUS automatically retains the individual's previous Expiry Date
- The system may occasionally set the date incorrectly

### Worker Responsibilities

Workers must:

- **Review the Expiry Date for accuracy** every time a case is reopened
- **Correct the Expiry Date manually** if the system set it incorrectly
- **Do not update the Expiry Date** when using the Delay Renewal button
- **Update the Expiry Date** only when the renewal is successfully completed

### Renewal-Specific Expiry Date Rules

When renewal cannot be completed due to unverified changes:

- Keep the original Expiry Date (do not add 12 months)
- Use the Delay Renewal button to prevent automatic updates
- Document the correct future Expiry Date in narratives (original date + 12 months)
- Update to the correct Expiry Date only when renewal is processed

---

## Notice Requirements

### Approval Notices

Required when:

- Reopening a case after closure
- Reinstating eligibility

Must include:

- Effective date of reopening
- Current eligibility determination

Must NOT include:

- Renewal language if it is not the individual's renewal period

### Renewal Notices

Required when:

- A renewal is successfully completed
- All verifications are obtained
- Eligibility is determined for the new period

Must include:

- Updated Expiry Date
- Renewal language appropriate to the determination

### Closure Notices

Must include:

- Closure reason
- Effective date of closure
- Appeal rights
