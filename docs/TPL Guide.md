## TPL Best Practices (Top Ten)

### 1. Medicaid is Payer of Last Resort

Medicaid is **always** the payer of last resort. It is important that the Agency obtains TPL information to ensure that TPL is billed first for services.

### 2. Medicare Buy-In Only Cases

Per information received from the COB Help Desk, TPL policies must **not** be entered into C1 for an individual that is Medicare Buy-In only.

**Exception**: If the individual becomes Medicaid eligible later, the information must be verified and entered into NFOCUS and C1, respectively.

### 3. Ask About TPL

If the TPL questions are not answered on the application, **ask the individual**.

### 4. At Initial Application

#### CHIP Creditable Coverage

If the pending children are enrolled in **creditable health insurance**, they are ineligible for CHIP. The case needs to be processed and staff must mark the **"Insured"** option on the TPL popup in order to have the children be denied by the system.

**FFM Coverage Exception**: If children are determined eligible for CHIP and have current Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM) coverage, eligibility may be determined and coverage overlap while the individual's FFM insurance is terminated.

**Follow-Up Required**: If the household indicates they have insurance and no further information is provided, follow-up is needed to determine:
- The type of insurance coverage (e.g., employer-sponsored coverage or FFM coverage)
- If this is still a current policy

#### Non-CHIP Approvals

If the children are approved and are enrolled in creditable health insurance but are **not approved for CHIP**, policy information must be requested as needed and added to C1.

### 5. Change Management - TPL Report on Active Case

If TPL is reported and the children in the case are in the CHIP category, the children are **continuously eligible** until the time of their annual renewal and must not be closed outside of that period.

See the [Continuous Eligibility Guide](Continuous%20Eligibility%20Guide.md) and NFOCUS Workarounds for Continuous Eligibility and 12 Month Postpartum for further information.

### 6. At Renewal

#### Medicare Buy-In to Medicaid

If the individual is eligible for Medicare Buy-In only and at renewal or change report the individual then becomes eligible for Medicaid, the worker must get verification of the individual's TPL policy and the expense. Once the TPL information is received, it must be entered into C1.

#### CHIP Renewal with Creditable Coverage

If the CHIP-approved children have been enrolled in creditable health insurance, they are **no longer eligible for CHIP** at renewal time as the child is no longer continuously eligible.

The case needs to be processed and staff must mark the **"Insured"** option on the TPL popup screen in order to have the children be denied by the system.

See the [Continuous Eligibility Guide](Continuous%20Eligibility%20Guide.md) for further information.

### 7. Cooperation Requirement

Cooperation with TPL is a **requirement for all programs**, MAGI and NON-MAGI. This includes participants who are current pay SSI.

### 8. Always Check C1

Always check C1 and upload the insurance information if needed. See the [C1 TPL Quick Reference Guide](C1%20TPL%20Quick%20Reference%20Guide.md) for further information.

### 9. Prenatal/Maternity Coverage and 599 CHIP

Individuals with medical insurance that covers **prenatal and maternity services** are not eligible for 599 CHIP.

### 10. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nebraska

C1 no longer electronically interfaces with Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) of **NEBRASKA**. BCBS coverage must be **manually entered** into C1.

### 11. Good Cause

An individual may claim good cause for not cooperating with TPL. However, establishing good cause is the individual's responsibility.

### 12. Closure for Non-Cooperation

Only **adults**, not children, can be closed or denied if TPL information is not provided.

### 13. Questionable Information

If there is questionable information, ask the individual for clarification.

### 14. Verification Requirements

Verification of the TPL policy is required (per Section 2 of this document below) to determine if the policy meets the criteria and can be allowed as an expense in the budget.

**On Medicare Buy-In only cases**: TPL policies are not entered into C1.

**Note**: Verification of a TPL expense is not a mandatory verification.

### 15. Medicare Buy-In Only

TPL policies must **not** be added to C1 if an individual is eligible for Medicare Buy-In only.

## TPL Non-MAGI Disregards

Medical insurance premiums are an allowable disregard if the individual, or financially responsible relative, is responsible for the payment(s) (477 NAC 22-005.03).

### Policy Requirement (477 000-026)

The health insurance policy must **provide or require specific medical or health service(s)** before benefits can be obtained.

If the policy pays strictly for a claim that does not require medical or health service, then the policy is **not allowed** as a disregard.

### Examples of Allowable Health Insurance

#### ✓ Hospital Daily Indemnity Policy

**Policy**: Pays $50 each day the individual is hospitalized.

**Result**: **ALLOWED** - The policy is considered health insurance because the individual must be hospitalized before benefits can be received. Hospitalization is considered a medical service.

#### ✓ Cancer Treatment Insurance

**Policy**: Pays $50 for each chemotherapy and radiation treatment.

**Result**: **ALLOWED** - The policy is considered health insurance because the individual must receive chemotherapy or radiation treatment before benefits from the policy can be obtained.

#### ✓ Long-Term Care Insurance

**Policy**: Pays $100 a day for each day an individual is in a nursing home.

**Result**: **ALLOWED** - This policy would be allowed because nursing home care is considered a medical service.

**Note**: Long-term care email: [DHHS.MedicaidLTCinsurance@nebraska.gov](mailto:DHHS.MedicaidLTCinsurance@nebraska.gov)

### Examples NOT Considered Health Insurance

#### ✗ Accident Income Replacement

**Policy**: Pays $50 a day for each day an individual misses work; there are no other benefits.

**Result**: **NOT ALLOWED** - This policy is not considered health insurance because it is considered an income replacement policy.

#### ✗ Cancer Lump Sum Payment

**Policy**: Pays a $5,000 lump payment if the individual is diagnosed with cancer; there are no other benefits.

**Result**: **NOT ALLOWED** - The policy is not allowed because it is strictly based on a diagnosis and does not require a specific medical or health service to claim a payment.

### Policies with Mixed Benefits

**Note**: If the above accident or cancer policies include medical service benefits as part of the policy and verification of these benefits was provided, then the premium may be allowed as a medical disregard.

**Examples**:
- If the accident insurance includes benefits for emergency room or surgery, it would be allowed
- If the cancer plan includes additional medical benefits, such as $100 for each chemotherapy or radiation treatment received, it would be allowed

## Medical Expenses

### Deduction Requirements (477 NAC 22-005.03)

The cost of medical insurance premiums is deducted if the individual or responsible relative is responsible for payment.

**Note**: The cost of premiums for income-producing policies is not allowed as a medical deduction. See Appendix (477-000-026) for more information.

### Verification Standard

In order to deduct a medical insurance premium in the budget, the worker must have verification that the medical expense is **incurred** by:
- An individual
- A person included in the household size of the individual
- A financially responsible relative

See **Policy Memo 18-05 Medical Expense**.

### "Incurred" Definition

For the purpose of this deduction, **incurred means to become liable for**, whether the expense is paid or unpaid. The Agency needs only to verify that the expense has been **incurred** in order to include the expense as a deduction in budgeting.

### Acceptable Verifications

1. A billing statement from the insurance company
2. A statement from the insurance agent noting the policy coverage and premium
3. Call made by the worker to the insurance company or agent, and documenting in the file
4. A bank account statement showing the premium as a deduction from the account
5. A receipt from the insurance company verifying that the premium has been paid

### Do NOT Accept

1. An application for insurance
2. Individual declaration or attestation
3. Employer's benefit package

### If Verification is Not Provided

If verification is not provided confirming that the medical insurance premium is incurred or paid:

1. **Do not close or deny** the case due to Failed to Provide Information
2. **Continue with the Medicaid eligibility determination** without the medical deduction included in the budget

## Medicare Advantage Plans (UHC Dual Complete)

### What is UHC Dual Complete?

A United HealthCare (UHC) Dual Complete Plan is a **Medicare Advantage HMO plan**, sometimes referred to as Medicare Part C. It combines an individual's Medicare Part A and B into one plan.

### Eligibility Requirements

Eligible individuals must reside within the plan's service area which includes the following counties:

**Service Area Counties**: Cass, Douglas, Lancaster, Sarpy, Adams, Buffalo, Burt, Dodge, Gage, Hall, Madison, Otoe, Saline, Saunders, Seward, and Washington.

Members are offered a variety of value-added services at no cost.

### Premium

There is **no premium** for individuals who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid.

### How to Identify These Plans

1. **Review the CMS Interface** - Part D Enrollment
2. **Compare with the current Medicare Part D Chart**
3. **If the plan is not listed on the chart**:
   - Attempt to contact the individual and determine if it should be explored as a Medicare Part C/Medicare Advantage Plan
   - If determined as a Medicare Part C/Medicare Advantage Plan, see: Understanding the Parts of Medicare

### Carrier Codes

### Important Notes

The UHC Medicare Advantage is **separate** from the Medicaid and Heritage Health cards. If the individual provides copies of their UnitedHealthcare Community Plan cards, the SSW should **not put these plans in C1** as these are the plans administered by Nebraska Medicaid.

A copy of the actual card is not needed if the policy information can be obtained (e.g., phone call) or is already on file.

### Adding UHC Dual Complete to C1

See [C1 TPL Quick Reference Guide](C1%20TPL%20Quick%20Reference%20Guide.md) for Eligibility Workers:

   - If this plan is from another state, include that information in the email
4. Document all case actions

## TRICARE/CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA

### Benefit Number Conversion

The Department of Defense (DOD) is in the process of converting all individuals with Tricare/CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA to a **Benefit Number** rather than using the person's SSN. Individuals would have a DOD ID Card.

If the individual has been issued a Benefit Number that is different from their SSN, the Benefit Number would need to be entered into C1.

### DOD Card Restrictions

**Note**: DOD cards **cannot be copied**. Individual attestation to their Benefit Number is acceptable.

### Process When TPL Attested

When the individual attests to TPL provided by TRICARE/CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA:

#### 1. Attempt Call-Out

Attempt a call-out to the individual to determine if they have a Benefit Number that is different than their SSN.

**If able to reach the individual**:
- If the Benefit Number is **different** than their SSN: Input this number into C1 as the participant Policy Number
- If the Benefit Number is the **same** as their SSN: Input this number into C1 as the participant Policy Number

**If unable to reach the individual**:
- Send a Verification Request asking the individual to verify their benefit number as listed on their DOD ID card number
- **Once received**:
  - If the Benefit Number is different than their SSN: Input this number into C1 as the participant Policy Number
  - If the Benefit Number is the same as their SSN: Input this number into C1 as the participant Policy Number

#### 2. If VR Not Received

If there is no reply/response to the VR by the due date, **close the non-CE/PW participant** using the reason of **Failed to Provide Information**.

### Important Note

Once the individual is issued their Benefit Number, their SSN can **no longer be used** in C1.
