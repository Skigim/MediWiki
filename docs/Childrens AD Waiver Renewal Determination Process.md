Maintenance of Eligibility (MOE) Unwind process or adjustments are noted in ‘Orange’
text.
Maintenance of Eligibility Unwind (MOE Unwind) – Through the Consolidated Appropriations Act
of 2023 that was passed by Congress at the end of December 2022, the PHE has been
separated out from the MOE requirement. The State of Nebraska has opted to begin the MOE
Unwind effective 3/1/2023. Adverse action on cases can begin on April 1st , 2023, after an MOE
Unwind Renewal is completed.
For cases requiring a disability determination by the State Review Team:
• If the Medical Impairment Review date is BEFORE the Medicaid MOE Unwind Renewal
due date, the Medical Impairment Review date will be extended to align with the
Medicaid MOE Unwind Renewal date.
• If the Medical Impairment Review date is AFTER to the Medicaid MOE Unwind Renewal
date, the process will begin with the alert that is generated 60 days prior to the Medical
Impairment Review date.
Please refer to the MLTC MOE Unwind Guidance for additional information.
Process:
1) Eligibility Operations initiates the SRT renewal process.
a) Eligibility Operations will review the list of cases that have both a required SRT review
and the Medicaid renewal is due to determine if SRT is still needed. Eligibility Operations
will notify the SRT of any cases that a Medical Review is indicated, but is no longer
needed. The remainder will continue to step b)
i) Once a MOE Unwind renewal has been completed, disability determination reviews
will return to being based on the SRT approval period.
b) The AD Waiver SSW attempts to reach the individual or individual’s representative 90
days before the expiration of the current SRT approval period, or at the initiation of the
MOE Unwind renewal process;
c) If contact is:
i) Made - the AD Waiver SSW:
(1) Explains the SRT renewal process and that a SRT VR#1 will be arriving in the
mail with documents for them to give to their medical provider(s); if this is a
review of a child with a previous SRT review that could not be completed or the
child did not meet disability criteria, inform the child’s representative that the SRT
review is required. Failure to complete the review at this time will result in a loss
of Medicaid eligibility, and therefore AD Waiver eligibility.
(2) Completes the DM-12 with the child’s representative and uploads it to DI; if the
SRT review is overdue due to the SOE then the DM-12 should reflect a start date
beginning the month of the new renewal period (example: Medicaid Renewal
date is 4/30/23 DM-12 request date would be 5/1/2023) and,
(3) Confirms with the child’s representative that any and all resources and income
sources listed in the budget are current and complete. Proceed to Step 2; or

<CHILD’S NAME> is due for a review of their disability status for continued Medicaid
and AD Waiver eligibility.
The enclosed DM-5 form needs to be completed by your child’s medical provider
who knows the most about their disability. This form allows that provider to describe
your child’s disability. Give it to your child’s provider to fill out.
You also need to request records from within the last 12 months that
document and specifically relate to your child’s disability. This could be from
more than one provider, if your child sees more than one provider about their
disability. When you contact your providers, please be sure to contact any therapy
and mental health providers. Clinic visit summaries from a patient portal cannot be
used. Your child’s providers must send a copy of the actual medical records. If your
child has an individualized education plan (IEP), MDT or IFSP, ask your child’s
school to send a copy.
Please review the enclosed Medical Documentation Guide for more information. If
you have any questions about records, contact dhhs.srtmedical@nebraska.gov.
Your child’s providers can send the completed DM-5 form and your child’s records to
the State Review Team any of the following ways:
Internet: www.accessnebraska.ne.gov
Email: DHHS.ANDICenter@Nebraska.gov
Fax: 402-742-2351
