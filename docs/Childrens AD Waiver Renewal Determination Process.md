# Children's AD Waiver Renewal Determination Process
*Streamlined Interdivisional Procedures for Children's Disability Renewal and MOE Unwind*

## Overview

This comprehensive guide outlines the interdivisional processes across MLTC (Division of Medicaid & Long-Term Care) and DDD (Division of Developmental Disabilities) for renewal determinations of disability and level of care within the context of Medicaid eligibility for children age 17 or younger continuing AD Waiver services. The process is designed to achieve timely, efficient, customer-focused results while accommodating the unique developmental and family-centered needs of children during renewal periods.

This guide includes specific provisions for the Maintenance of Eligibility (MOE) Unwind process, which began effective March 1, 2023, following the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023. The MOE Unwind process separated the Public Health Emergency from the Maintenance of Eligibility requirement, allowing adverse action on cases beginning April 1, 2023, after an MOE Unwind Renewal is completed.

**Effective Date:** March 1, 2023  
**Scope:** Applies to renewal of current disability status for individuals age 17 or younger receiving AD Waiver services

---

## Section 1: MOE Unwind Provisions

### 1.1 MOE Unwind Overview

The Maintenance of Eligibility Unwind (MOE Unwind) process was implemented through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 passed by Congress in December 2022. Nebraska opted to begin the MOE Unwind effective March 1, 2023, with adverse action on cases beginning April 1, 2023, after an MOE Unwind Renewal is completed.

### 1.2 Medical Impairment Review Date Alignment

For cases requiring a disability determination by the State Review Team:

**If the Medical Impairment Review date is BEFORE the Medicaid MOE Unwind Renewal due date:**
- The Medical Impairment Review date will be extended to align with the Medicaid MOE Unwind Renewal date

**If the Medical Impairment Review date is AFTER the Medicaid MOE Unwind Renewal date:**
- The process will begin with the alert generated 60 days prior to the Medical Impairment Review date
- Standard renewal procedures apply

**Once a MOE Unwind renewal has been completed:**
- Disability determination reviews will return to being based on the SRT approval period

> **Reference:** For additional MOE Unwind information, refer to the MLTC MOE Unwind Guidance

---

## Section 2: Renewal Process Initiation

### 2.1 Eligibility Operations Review

Eligibility Operations initiates the SRT renewal process by reviewing cases that have both a required SRT review and a Medicaid renewal due.

**Process Steps:**

1. **Determine SRT Need:**
   - Eligibility Operations reviews the list of cases
   - Determines if SRT review is still needed
   - Notifies SRT of any cases where Medical Review is indicated but no longer needed

2. **Continue to Contact Step:**
   - Cases where SRT review IS still needed proceed to Step 2.2

### 2.2 Initial Contact with Child's Representative

The AD Waiver SSW attempts to reach the child's representative 90 days before the expiration of the current SRT approval period, or at the initiation of the MOE Unwind renewal process.

### 2.3 Contact Made Scenario

**If contact IS successfully made:**

The AD Waiver SSW will:

1. **Explain the SRT Renewal Process:**
   - Explain that SRT VR#1 will arrive in mail with documents to give to medical providers
   - If this is a review of a child with a previous SRT review that could not be completed OR the child did not meet disability criteria, inform the representative that the SRT review is required
   - **Critical:** Failure to complete the review will result in loss of Medicaid eligibility and therefore AD Waiver eligibility

2. **Complete DM-12:**
   - Complete Work History and Education Verification Form (DM-12) with child's representative
   - Upload to Document Imaging
   - **If the SRT review is overdue due to the State of Emergency:** The DM-12 should reflect a start date beginning the month of the new renewal period
     - Example: Medicaid Renewal date is 4/30/23, DM-12 request date would be 5/1/2023

3. **Confirm Resources and Income:**
   - Confirm with representative that all resources and income sources listed in budget are current and complete

4. **Proceed to Step 3** (Send SRT VR#1)

### 2.4 Contact Not Made Scenario

**If contact is NOT successfully made:**

The AD Waiver SSW will:

1. Complete DM-12 independently
2. Upload to Document Imaging
3. Proceed to Step 3 (Send SRT VR#1)

---

## Section 3: Medical Documentation and SRT Process

### 3.1 Send SRT VR#1

The AD Waiver SSW sends SRT VR#1 with a 30-day due date within 1 business day of contact or attempted contact with the child's representative.

1. Copy of DM-5 Form
2. Copy of Medical Documentation Guide for Parents and Guardians – Disability Review for Children

> *The enclosed DM-5 form needs to be completed by your child's medical provider who knows the most about their disability. This form allows that provider to describe your child's disability. Give it to your child's provider to fill out.*
>
> *You also need to request records from within the last 12 months that document and specifically relate to your child's disability. This could be from more than one provider, if your child sees more than one provider about their disability. When you contact your providers, please be sure to contact any therapy and mental health providers. Clinic visit summaries from a patient portal cannot be used. Your child's providers must send a copy of the actual medical records. If your child has an individualized education plan (IEP), MDT or IFSP, ask your child's school to send a copy.*
>
> *Please review the enclosed Medical Documentation Guide for more information. If you have any questions about records, contact dhhs.srtmedical@nebraska.gov.*

>
> *The State Review Team will review the completed DM-5 Form and records that are submitted. Based on this review, they will determine if your child is currently disabled according to Social Security's rules. The result of their decision will be provided to you.*
>
> *Failure to complete this review process may result in a loss of Medicaid Eligibility and/or AD Waiver services.*
