# MIWD Eligibility Process Guide

## Medicaid Insurance for Workers with Disabilities

### Overview

Effective October 1, 2021, the Medicaid Insurance for Workers with Disabilities (MIWD) program is made up of two eligibility categories: the Basic Coverage Group and the Medical Improvement Group. Working individuals who are otherwise eligible for Medicaid, except for income, and are not eligible for another full Medicaid category may be eligible for the MIWD program under the new guidelines. This guide outlines eligibility factors and process steps specifically used to determine MIWD eligibility and must be used in conjunction with the MLTC Processing Guide and the MLTC Change Management Guide.

**Important**: If an individual is eligible in another full Medicaid coverage category, they should be approved in that category and not in either MIWD category. This does not include the buy-in only (SLMB/QI-1) or Medically Needy/Share of Cost categories.

**Premium Calculation**: If the individual's income is at least 200%, but less than 250% FPL in either the MIWD BCG or MIWD MIG budget, NFOCUS will calculate a premium amount due.

### G. Narrate Actions

The assigned worker will narrate the actions taken in the case.

### H. Review System Generated Notice

The assigned worker will review the system generated notice once the case is checked in to assure that appropriate information is displayed on the notice. The worker may need to update comments with specific information that may not be captured (e.g., manual references, etc.) prior to sending. For additional guidance, the worker should refer to the Special Processing Notes at the beginning of Section 4 of this Guide.
