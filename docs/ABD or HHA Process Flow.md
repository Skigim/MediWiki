# ABD or HHA/MAGI Expansion Process Flow

*Nebraska Medicaid Long-Term Care Policy*

---

## Overview

This process flow helps eligibility workers determine whether an individual should be processed under the **ABD (Aged, Blind, Disabled)** category or the **HHA (Healthy and Happy Adults)/MAGI Expansion** category. The decision depends on disability status, Medicare eligibility, income, resources, and waiver service needs.

## Disability Determination Flow

### Step 1: Is the applicant or beneficiary disabled by SSA or SRT?

**If YES**, continue to [Step 2: Medicare Check](#step-2-medicare-eligibility)

**If NO**, skip to [Step 5: Waiver Services Check](#step-5-waiver-services-request)

---

## Medicare and SSI Considerations

### Step 2: Medicare Eligibility

**Is the applicant or beneficiary entitled to or enrolled in Medicare?**

- **If YES** → Process eligibility for **ABD**
- **If NO** → Continue to [Step 3](#step-3-ssi-status)

See [Policy Log - Early Retirement vs. Disability](README.md) for help determining if an individual is disabled by SSA or receiving early retirement.

### Step 3: SSI Status

**Is the applicant or beneficiary receiving SSI?**

- **If YES** → Process eligibility for **ABD**
- **If NO** → Continue to [Step 4](#step-4-income-and-resource-check)

### Step 4: Income and Resource Check

**Does the applicant or beneficiary have income below 100% FPL and under the applicable resource limit for ABD?**

Consider income disregards such as:
- DAC disregard
- Earned income disregards

- **If YES** → Process eligibility for **ABD**
- **If NO** → Continue to [Step 5](#step-5-waiver-services-request)

---

## Waiver Services Pathway

### Step 5: Waiver Services Request

**Is the applicant or beneficiary requesting waiver services?**

- **If YES** → Continue to [Step 6](#step-6-srt-determination-needed)
- **If NO** → Process eligibility for **HHA/MAGI Expansion**

### Step 6: SRT Determination Needed

**Does the applicant or beneficiary need an SRT determination (477 NAC 27-002.02(C)(ii)(2)) OR is the SRT determination needed to meet criteria for waiver eligibility?**

#### If YES:
Process eligibility for **HHA/MAGI Expansion** until an SRT determination is made.

**Important**: If an individual becomes disabled by SRT and eligible for waiver, follow Step 6b below.

The waiver referral should **not be sent** until there is a disability determination by either SRT or SSA.

**Special Consideration**: If the applicant has recently been denied disability by SSA for a lack of duration or a lack of severity **for the same condition**, then process as **HHA/MAGI Expansion**. These individuals are not appropriate for SRT referral or eligible for waiver services.

#### If NO:
Process eligibility for **ABD**.

**If not eligible for ABD** (e.g., excess income or resources, failed to provide resources, failed to provide information), process as **HHA/MAGI Expansion** if all MAGI information is verified or verifications are provided.

When ineligible for HHA/MAGI Expansion due to income, review for:
1. MIWD criteria (see [Step 7](#step-7-miwd-review))
2. ABD MN with SOC

**If a resource spenddown is requested**, process as **ABD**.

## MIWD Review

### Step 7: MIWD Eligibility

**If the applicant is not eligible for ABD or HHA/MAGI Expansion due to income or Medicare eligibility**, determine if MIWD may apply:

**Criteria to check**:
- Between the ages of 16-64
- Is (or declares to be) disabled
- Has earnings from employment or self-employment

**If criteria met**: Assign to the MIWD position number, if needed.

## Process Flow Examples

### Example 1: SSA Denial for Lack of Severity

**Client A** applies for Medicaid. The application indicates that Client A is disabled. When the SDX record is checked, it shows a denial for lack of severity the month prior to the Medicaid application.

**Result**: This individual would **not be eligible for ABD**. Processing would proceed as **HHA/MAGI Expansion**. No SRT or waiver referral would be sent, unless a change in their condition is indicated.

### Example 2: Disabled with Income Above 100% FPL

**Client B** applies for Medicaid, and the application indicates a disability. The BDE record shows that Client B is disabled, but not yet eligible for Medicare. Client B's income equates to 110% FPL. There is no request for waiver services.

**Result**: Client B would be processed as **HHA/MAGI Expansion**.

### Example 3: Approved for HHA, Later Requests Waiver

**Client B** (from above) is approved as HHA/MAGI Expansion. Three months after approval, Client B requests waiver services. A referral is sent to a local agency for an assessment, which is approved.

**Result**: Client B would transition to **MIWD** (if criteria are met) or **ABD MN with a SOC** when waiver services begin.

### Example 4: Disabled with Excess Resources

**Client C** applies and indicates a disability. The BDE record shows a current pay status, but no Medicare eligibility. Client C's income equates to 90% FPL, so processing begins as ABD. When Client C's resources are verified, the countable resources are $12,000.

**Result**: Client C would be **ineligible for ABD**, and processing would proceed as **HHA/MAGI Expansion**.

### Example 5: Resources Exceed Limit, Waiver Services Needed

After eligibility is determined, **Client C** reports a need for waiver services. Client C has a disability determination, so a referral for a waiver assessment can be completed. If the assessment shows a need for services, then Client C would be able to receive waiver services in **HHA/MAGI Expansion** because there is no eligibility for ABD due to resources.

**Note**: Eligibility for another category would need to be reviewed at subsequent renewals or if other information is received.

### Example 6: Estranged Spouse - Tax Household vs. ABD Household

**Client D** applies and indicates a disability. The BDE record shows that Client D is disabled, but not eligible for Medicare. Client D's income is equal to 115% FPL. Medicaid proceeds to be processed as HHA/MAGI Expansion.

In collecting the tax household information, Client D reports having an estranged spouse. The household expects to file jointly. With the income of the estranged spouse considered in the tax household, the income is 200% FPL. Client D does not qualify for HHA/MAGI Expansion.

**Result**: Because Client D does not live with the estranged spouse, ABD can be determined based on Client D's income alone. The resources in Client D's name would be verified. If below $4,000, Client D could be approved as **MIWD** (if criteria are met) or **ABD MN with a SOC**.

### Example 7: No Disability Determination - SRT Referral Needed

**Client E** applies, indicates a disability, and requests waiver services. The SDX and BDE records do not show a disability determination or a pending application for benefits.

**Result**: A referral would need to be sent to **SRT** for a disability determination before eligibility for ABD or waiver services can be determined.

### Example 8: Failed to Provide Resources

**Client F** applies and indicates a disability. The BDE record shows current pay status, but no Medicare entitlement or eligibility. Client F's income is under 100% FPL, so processing begins with ABD. A VR is sent for resource information and Client F fails to provide the resource needed to process ABD.

**Result**: Client F could then be processed as **HHA/MAGI Expansion**, if all information is available for the MAGI determination. Eligibility for another category would need to be reviewed at subsequent renewals or if other information is received.

### Example 9: Entitled to Medicare

**Client G** applies and indicates a disability. The BDE record shows current pay status, and entitled to Medicare coverage. Client G is entitled to Medicare coverage, therefore is not eligible for HHA/MAGI Expansion coverage.

**Result**: Client G would be processed as **ABD**. If income is in excess of 100% FPL, Client G would be processed as **MIWD** (if criteria are met) or **ABD MN with a SOC**.
