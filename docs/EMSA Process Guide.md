# EMSA Process Guide

## Emergency Medical Services Assistance Processing for SRT Eligibility Operations

### Overview

This guide is designed to assist workers on the SRT Eligibility Operations (EO) team who handle Emergency Medical Services Assistance (EMSA) assignments. EMSA provides limited Medicaid coverage for emergency medical services to individuals who meet all Medicaid eligibility requirements except for having qualified non-citizen status. This guide ensures each team member follows a defined process when processing an EMSA case.

## Application Review Process

### Initial Application Review

Workers must review the Medicaid application thoroughly for important information:

#### Household Composition

- Check if there are other individuals reported on the application or listed in the Master Case that are related to the individual applying
- Review household composition to clarify family relationships and/or financial responsibility

#### Authorized Representative

Check if there is an Authorized Representative (AR) for the individual applying. This information may be reported on the application or listed in the Master Case.

**If there is an AR**:
1. Determine if that role has been added to the case
2. If the AR role has not been added to the case, this information will need to be added
3. See the Application Management Guide for additional information

**If there isn't an AR**: No additional action is needed

#### Application Comments Section

Review to see if there is any other helpful information reported in the comments section:

- Act on the information accordingly
- Look for dates of service(s) or other clues that the individual may be applying for EMSA
- Look for dates of service(s) being requested
- Look for reason for the hospitalization
- Look for other information pertaining to the request for EMSA services

#### Immigration Status Information

Check the application for any listed immigration status information and determine if the information is current in NFOCUS (use VLP/SAVE, if necessary).

Immigration information may be:
- Reported on the application
- Filed in Document Imaging (DI)
- Indicated in prior narratives

The worker may have to request the most recent immigration documents from the individual.

## Eligibility Determination

### MLTC Processing Guide Review

Review the application using the MLTC Processing Guide to determine if the individual meets Medicaid eligibility requirements **with the exception of having a qualified non-citizen status**.

**If the individual does NOT meet Medicaid eligibility requirements** (with the exception of a qualified non-citizen status):
- Follow the process in the MLTC Processing Guide to deny the application for the applicable reason
- Send a notice

**If the individual DOES meet Medicaid eligibility requirements** (with the exception of a qualified non-citizen status):
- Proceed with the EMSA process

### MAGI vs. Non-MAGI Determination

Determine if the individual meets MAGI or Non-MAGI eligibility.

**Important**: Review all Medicaid categories that do NOT require a disability first, and then review all Medicaid categories that DO require a disability to ensure eligibility consideration is provided for all categories.

#### Example 1: Non-MAGI with Disability Required

A 63-year-old, single individual indicates they are disabled. Their income exceeds all MAGI income limits.

**Result**: They would need to meet a disability criteria along with an emergent criteria to be reviewed for Non-MAGI eligibility for EMSA.

#### Example 2: MAGI Category - No Disability Required

A 63-year-old, single individual indicates they are disabled. Their income is within a MAGI category income limit.

**Result**: They would only need to meet the emergent criteria and not a disability to be reviewed for EMSA. Non-MAGI eligibility for the individual would not be reviewed as they were found eligible in a MAGI category and meet an emergent criteria.

### Non-MAGI Verification Requirements

If EMSA eligibility is being determined in the Non-MAGI category:

**If the individual DOES have an SSN**:
1. Use AVS as the primary verification source
2. See additional information in the AVS Procedural Guide
3. Verify income and all other eligibility requirements accordingly

**If the individual does NOT have an SSN**:
1. The worker will be unable to use AVS to verify resources
2. The worker will also be unable to verify the individual's income or eligibility requirements via interfaces
3. Include the request for resource, income, and all other eligibility requirement information on a VR, as applicable
4. Send the VR to the individual and the AR

## DM-13 Social Study Process

### Determining Dates of Services

If the individual appears to meet MAGI or Non-MAGI eligibility:

1. **Determine if there are medical dates of services (DOS) being requested** for the emergency treatment
   - Information may be in DI

2. **If information is still missing**:

   **Attempt phone contact**:
   - Contact the AR or the individual via phone call
   - If able to reach them:
     - Verify dates of services
     - Ask if assistance is being requested due to an accident
       - If yes, follow the information in the Third Party Liability Policy Log

   **If phone call unsuccessful**:
   - Send a VR to obtain the dates of services
   - Request information about if the services needed pertain to an accident
   - If assistance is being requested due to an accident, follow the Third Party Liability Policy Log

3. **Review the dates of services** provided by the individual to determine if the services covered meet the EMSA eligibility requirements at 477 NAC 27-009.01

   **If does NOT meet EMSA eligibility requirements**:
   - Deny the application for Eligibility Requirements Not Met
   - Add 477 NAC 27-009.01 to the comment section of the notice
   - Send a notice

   **If DOES meet EMSA eligibility requirements**:
   - Proceed to complete the DM-13

### Completing the DM-13 (EMSA Social Study)

1. **Document** the dates of services in the narrative

2. **Upload** the completed DM-13 into DI

3. **Email** the completed DM-13 to Health Services: DHHS.SRTMedical@nebraska.gov

### Email Template for Health Services

Use the following template when emailing the DM-13:

- **Client Name**:
- **Master Case**:
- **Person Number or ARP ID**:
- **Dates of Services**:
  - Date 1:
  - Date 2 (If more than one):
- **Authorized Rep/Guardian**:
- **Type of Referral**:
- **Disability declared, if known**:
- **DM-13**: EMSA Social Study Form (attached)
- **Comments**:

**Note**: An Agency Related Person ID or ARP ID/Person Number is found in the Person Detail Window of NFOCUS.

## Health Services Coordination

### If Verification Request Not Met

**If the EO VR Due alert is received, and if the requested information is not received**:

1. Deny the case for failure to provide information
2. Notify Health Services of the denial by emailing DHHS.SRTMedical@nebraska.gov
3. Remain assigned to the case to process any further actions through the 90-day redetermination period
4. Send a notice of action

### If Documents Received After Denial

**If all requested documents on a denied case are received and the verification process is resumed**:

1. Notify Health Services by emailing DHHS.SRTMedical@nebraska.gov
2. Health services will then resume collection of medical records
3. As verifications for income, resources, citizenship, etc. are received, update the information in the NFOCUS Expert system

### Health Services Determination Process

After the individual provides all needed EO documentation (either initially or within the 90-day redetermination period):

- Health Services will make a determination on if the individual meets an emergent medical condition and/or disability (if required) for the requested dates of services

### Failure to Provide Medical Documentation

Health Services will not make a determination on an emergent medical condition and/or disability (if required) for the requested dates of services if their area does not receive medical documentation.

**Process**:
1. Health Services must notify the worker of whether or not the individual is approved or denied based on the medical documentation only
2. This information is obtained from the completed MLTC-73 that Health Services scans into DI
3. If the individual fails to provide the medical documentation, Health Services will email this information to the worker
4. Once the email is received, the worker denies the Medicaid application for failure to provide information and sends a notice of action
5. Keep the case assigned throughout the 90-day redetermination period
6. Unassign after that date OR after the case has been processed

### 90-Day Redetermination Period

If the individual provides the needed medical information to Health Services within the 90-day redetermination period:

1. Health Services will review the information
2. Health Services will make a determination on the emergent medical condition
3. Once Health Services has reviewed the medical information and has made their determination, they will set an SRT Response alert
4. Health Services will upload the MLTC-73 into DI

## Disability Determinations

### When Disability Review Is Required

If the disability category is marked on the DM-13, Health Services is required to determine disability **prior to** the dates of services being reviewed.

### Disability Denial Process

**Health Services notifies the worker of the denial for disability** via note on the MLTC-73. This information is obtained by the worker from the completed MLTC-73 that Health Services scans into DI.

**Worker actions**:

1. **Deny the Medicaid application** for eligibility requirements not met

2. **Send a notice of action** and include the following:

   **English version**:
   > Based on the medical information submitted for Emergency Medical Services Assistance, it has been determined that your condition does not meet the disability requirement for Medicaid eligibility. This pertains to your EMSA request for the following dates of services ________. The manual references that support this notice are 477 NAC 2-001 and 27-009.01.

   **Spanish version** (if individual has 'Spanish' identified as their primary written language):

## Approval Process

### If Approved by Health Services

When the individual is approved by Health Services:

#### Step 1: Review Approved Dates

Review the dates of services listed on the MLTC-73 that the individual is approved for.

#### Step 2: Enter EMSA Approval Dates

Enter the EMSA approval dates under **Medical Impairment → SRT Emergency Medical For Aliens** in the NFOCUS Expert System.

**Requirements**:
- A begin date and end date must be entered
- The SRT Form DM-5R must be selected as the Verification Source for each of the approval dates entered

**Example 1**: The individual is approved for the dates of services of May 5th.
- May 5th is entered as the begin date AND the end date

**Example 2**: If the dates of services are all inclusive, enter the dates together.
- September 13th-20th: September 13th is entered as the begin date and September 20th is entered as the end date

**Example 3**: If the dates of services are for multiple days and there is a gap between the days, enter the dates separately.
- September 13th and September 20th (with gap between):
  - September 13th is entered as the begin and end date
  - September 20th is also entered (separately) as the begin and end date

**Note**: If a portion of the dates are approved and a portion of them are denied, ensure that the dates are clearly outlined in the comment section of the Notice of Action.

#### Step 3: Enter Additional Information

Once the dates of services are entered:

1. Enter all other financial and non-financial information into NFOCUS
2. Follow the additional steps in the MLTC Processing Guide

#### Step 4: Process Budgets

Once all applicable information is entered into NFOCUS:

1. **Process the budgets** for the months that correspond with the approved dates of services as determined by Health Services
2. **Deny months** that do not correspond directly with the approved dates of services as determined by Health Services

**Example**: The individual's application was received in May and the individual is approved for dates of services in May and July.

- **Process** the May budget
- **Deny** the June budget for Ineligible Alien (the individual did NOT request dates of services to be covered for this month)
- **Process** the July budget
- **Close** the case for August for Ineligible Alien (the individual did NOT request dates of services to be covered for this month)

**Additional Dates of Services Within 90 Days**:
- If at a later time within the 90 days from the closure date (7/31) the individual requests additional dates of services coverage, follow the outlined process above and process the additional dates of services requested (if Health Services approves the additional dates of services requested AND the individual meets all other EMSA eligibility requirements)

**Additional Dates of Services After 90 Days**:
- If the request to cover additional dates of services is outside of the 90-day timeframe, a new application is needed

**Note**: If the individual is denied for not meeting eligibility requirements (with the exception of a qualified non-citizen status) and then later requests other dates of services after their application has been denied, the individual must submit a new application.

#### Step 5: Send Notice of Action

Send a Notice of Action and include the following:

**English version**:
> Based on the medical information submitted for Emergency Medical Services Assistance, it has been determined that your condition meets the EMSA eligibility requirement for the following dates of services _________. The manual references that support this notice are 477 NAC 2-001 and 27-009.01.

**Spanish version** (if individual has "Spanish" identified as their primary written language):
> Basada en la información presentada para la Asistencia de Servicios Médicos de Emergencia, se ha determinado que su condición cumple con el requisito de elegibilidad de EMSA para las siguientes fechas de servicio ____________________. Las referencias de manual que sustentan este aviso son 477 NAC 2-001 y 27-009.01.

**Add the comments** on the MLTC-73 from the Medical Director/Nurse/Doctor and/or Nebraska State Review Team Determination.

#### Step 6: Final Review and Unassign

1. Review the notice for accuracy prior to sending
2. Unassign the case

### Example of Partial Approval

**Dates of Services Requested**: May 5th and May 6th, 2022, and July 2nd, 2022

**Dates of Services Approved**: May 5th and May 6th, 2022

**Dates of Services Denied**: July 2nd, 2022

The notice must clearly specify which dates were approved and which were denied in the comment section.
