**If AD Waiver services are NOT being requested and not appropriate to consider:**
- This SOP does not apply
- Stop here

**If AD Waiver services ARE being requested or otherwise are appropriate to consider:**
- The Eligibility Operations SSW proceeds to Step 2

**1b) If AD Waiver services are requested outside of a Medicaid application:**

For an individual 18 years old or older, the Eligibility Operations SSW looks to see if a Medicaid application is needed:

**If a Medicaid application is NOT needed:**
- Proceed to Step 2

**If a Medicaid application IS needed:**
- The Eligibility Operations SSW notifies the individual or representative of the need to apply

  **If an application is not received:**
  - This SOP does not apply
  - Stop here

  **If an application is received:**
  - Proceed to Step 2

#### Step 2: Review Marital Status and Spousal Waiver Participation

The case is reviewed to determine if the individual requesting services is married or unmarried:

**If the individual requesting services is UNMARRIED:**
- Proceed to Step 3

**If the individual requesting services is MARRIED:**

Determine who is requesting AD Waiver services (one spouse or both):

**If BOTH spouses are requesting AD Waiver services:**

**The E&E Unit:**

- Sends a **denial NOA for the AD Waiver**

**The Eligibility Operations Assigned SSW:**

**The case remains assigned** to the Eligibility Operations SSW and the SRT CA for a 90-day period.

**If records ARE NOT submitted by the 90-days:**

1. The Eligibility Operations Assigned SSW closes all assignments and returns the case to UC
2. Stop here

**If records ARE submitted by the 90-day due date:**

- Proceed to Step 9

#### Step 9: When Records Are Submitted in Response to SRT VR#1

**If records are submitted to ACCESSNE:**
- The ANDI Center indexes and uploads the records to DI in the master case in N-FOCUS
- This generates an alert in N-FOCUS

**If records are submitted to the Eligibility Operations Assigned SSW:**
- The Eligibility Operations Assigned SSW indexes and uploads the records to DI in the master case in N-FOCUS
- This generates an alert in N-FOCUS

**All other alerts** for Medicaid eligibility are worked by the Eligibility Operations Assigned SSW as outlined in the MLTC Processing Guide.

**The SRT CA:**

1. **Checks for alerts in N-FOCUS daily**
2. **Receives any records**
3. **Clears the alert** if the alert is only for medical records. If other documents are received with the medical records, the alert will be left for the Eligibility Operations Assigned SSW to clear

2. **Reviews within 5 business days** all received records and applies SSA Clinical guidelines (please refer to the SRT Clinical Review Process Guide for Child AD Waiver for further details)

**If additional records ARE NOT needed:**
- Proceeds to Step 12

**If additional records ARE needed:**
