Process:
1) Eligibility Operations receives an AD Waiver request
a) When a Medicaid application is received for an individual 18 years old or older, an
Eligibility Operations SSW reviews the Medicaid application to determine if AD Waiver
services are being requested or otherwise are appropriate to consider:
i) If AD Waiver services are not being requested and not otherwise appropriate to
consider, this SOP does not apply. Stop here; or
ii) If AD Waiver services are being requested or otherwise are appropriate to consider,
the Eligibility Operations SSW proceeds to Step 2; or
b) If AD Waiver services are requested outside of a Medicaid application for an individual
18 years old or older, the Eligibility Operations SSW looks to see if a Medicaid
application is needed:
i) If a Medicaid application is not needed, proceed to Step 2; or
ii) If a Medicaid application is needed, the Eligibility Operations SSW notifies the
individual or the individual’s representative of the need to apply and;

a) If the individual is age 65 or older, send an email to the E&E unit with the referral for AD
Waiver services and proceed to Step 19; or

if there is a current disability determination:
i) If Yes, send an email to the E&E unit with the referral for AD Waiver services and
proceed to Step 19; or
ii) If no, assign case to EMSA/SRT position number 75013343 and proceed to Step 4.
