## Key Definitions

**Reasonable Opportunity Period:** A 90-day timeframe given to verify an individual's attested citizenship or satisfactory non-citizen status. This period encompasses all aspects of the process to verify citizenship or immigration status, including time for the individual to provide documentation and time for the Department to resolve inconsistencies or conclude the electronic verification process.

**Electronic Verification Process:** The use of federal data systems (such as SSA interface, VLP/SAVE) to verify citizenship or immigration status electronically before requesting paper documentation.

**Retroactive Medicaid:** Medical coverage for up to three months prior to the month of application. Cannot be authorized during the reasonable opportunity period per 42 CFR 435.956(a)(5)(iii).

## 90-Day Timeframe

### Calculating the Period

### Notice Requirements

The Department must provide notice of the reasonable opportunity period. The notice must inform the individual:
- They have 90 days from receipt of the notice to provide documentation
- The specific date by which verification must be completed
