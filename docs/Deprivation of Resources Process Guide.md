Deprivation of Resources Process Guide
All manual references are from 477 NAC Chapter 23, unless noted otherwise.
Regulations can be accessed at the Secretary of State website.
Background: Deprivation is the elimination or reduction of recorded ownership or control of a
resource for less than fair market value (FMV) (Ex: transfer, sale or change of ownership in a
resource). The FMV of a resource at the time it was disposed of must be verified and compared
to the equity value and any compensation received. Findings must be thoroughly documented in
the case narrative regardless of whether a penalty is being imposed at the time. 477 NAC 23
003.04.
Fair Market Value
The price of an item of a particular make, model, size, material, or condition will sell for on
the open market in the geographic area involved. The fair market value of a resource at the
time the resource was disposed of must be verified and the equity value of the resource must
be determined by taking into consideration any encumbrances against the resource.
Public tax records or county assessor records may be used to determine the sale value of a
resource. If there is a question as to the accuracy of the sale value determined by these
records, verification may be obtained from a real estate agent, car dealer, or other
appropriate individual. 477 NAC 23 003.03(D)(ii)
Equity is the actual value of property, the price at which it could be sold, less the total of
encumbrances against it. If encumbrances again the property equal or exceed the price for
which the property could be sold, the client has no equity, and the property is not an
available resource. 477 NAC 23 003.03(D), 23 003.03 (D)(i), and 23 003.03 (A)
The criteria for fair market value are NOT met when:
1. The term of the financial instrument* exceeds the life expectancy of the individual;
Example: An annuity purchased that will pay out for 15 years by a Medicaid
eligible individual with a life expectancy of eight (8) years.
2. The financial instrument does not provide for equal monthly or annual payments
commencing immediately during the term of the contract;
Example: A land contract that a Medicaid eligible individual enters into with
another individual. The contract is for 15 years total. Payments are for
$800.00 per month for the first five (5) years of the contract, starting
immediately. Then, starting year six (6) and continuing through year 15 the
payments are $1,200 per month.
3. The financial instrument does not provide for the recovery of assets in the event of
default;
MLTC PAS NEW 6/2025

Example: A contract drawn up between family members where one agrees to
purchase a family member’s home. The contract does not include a clause in
it that protects the seller of the property (the Medicaid applicant). If the
purchaser defaults on the loan (does not pay) there is no way the Medicaid
applicant can get the property back from the purchaser due to them defaulting
on the loan. The Medicaid applicant does not have the property and is also
not receiving payments for the property they sold.
4. The financial instrument contains exculpatory or cancellation terms of balance due;
Example: A contract drawn up for purchase of a car. The Medicaid applicant
agrees to sell their car to their neighbor for $18,000 by paying $500 per
month. The car is for the neighbor’s 17-year-old son. The contract includes
verbiage that it will terminate once the neighbor’s son turns 18 years old (in
12 months). The applicant will not receive the amount due on the contract.
5. The purpose of a transaction is solely to become eligible; or
Example: A Medicaid eligible individual receives an inheritance that
includes a lot with a storage shed on it. The client reports the information to
DHHS and it’s discussed that the sale of the lot would put the client over
resources for Medicaid. A VR is sent to the client for follow up on the sale of
the lot. The client indicates they signed over ownership of the lot to the
church next to it. The client received nothing in return.
6. The value received for the transfer of any resource is less than the expected value
which would have been received on an open market for a similar resource of the
same type.
Example: A Medicaid eligible individual has a classic car that is valued at
$25,000 by a classic car dealer. The client sells the car to their son for
$10,000 because they want to give their son a good deal on the car for
helping them keep it clean.
* Financial instrument includes, but is not limited to stocks, bonds, trusts, annuities,
and contracts.
Deprivation must be reviewed if the individual or their spouse resides in a specified living
arrangement (also known as Long-Term Care or LTC), which is defined as:
1. A nursing home;
2. Receiving skilled level of care in hospital;
3. Receiving Home and Community-Based Services (waiver services), including an assisted
living waiver, Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE services), or
requesting and meeting the criteria for such services; and/or
4. An intermediate care facility (ICF).

Change Effective 2/1/2025:
Individuals who have income below 100% FPL and request waiver services will now be exempt
from the deprivation review process. This includes those individuals receiving waiver services at
home and those receiving waiver services in a residential facility. Any person who resides, or
will likely reside, in a medical facility (Hospital, Nursing Facility, or ICF) for more than one full
calendar month will still be subject to a deprivation of resources review.
The following eligibility groups will not be subject to a deprivation of resources review if
waiver services are requested:
1. 100% FPL Aged and Disabled;
2. Disabled Adult Children (DAC);
3. Pickle Group:
4. ARF Widow(er)s;
5. Disabled Widow(er)s;
6. Former Foster Care (FFC);
7. MIWD;
8. Medicaid recipients who received State Supplement (AABD Grant);
9. SSI recipients; and
10. 1619b beneficiaries.
*However, these eligibility groups will still be subject to a deprivation of resources
review if they transition into a medical facility for more than one full calendar month
(referenced above).
*Similarly, these eligibility groups would become subject to a deprivation review while
receiving waiver services if there is a change in circumstance which moves them into a
different eligibility group, like medically needy.
It is important to narrate if you are aware of any potential deprivation of resource issues in the
event that they become subject to a deprivation review.
For all initial waiver requests at initial or new applications:
The worker must compare the individual’s verified countable income to the 100% FPL. This is
done because the worker may not be sure of the Medicaid category the individual may be eligible
for initially.
1. If the individual’s income is below the 100% FPL amount, then the worker does not need
to complete the deprivation review.
a. Proceed with a referral to E&E to begin determining eligibility for the requested
waiver.
2. If the individual’s income is above the 100% FPL amount, then the worker must complete
a deprivation review. (A deprivation review is needed prior to waiver services being
activated.)
MLTC PAS NEW 6/2025

Delayed COLA provisions apply for determinations made between December and the
implementation of the new FPL amounts the following year. (This is recurring each year).
Some exceptions to this include:
1. If the applicant has earned income, this is an indication of possible MIWD eligibility;
2. If the applicant is receiving a “C” claim from SSA and has resources less than $2,000,
then the worker must review for DAC eligibility.
Determining countable income may include certain considerations:
Most of the time, it should be easy to determine whether the applicant’s income is below the
100% FPL or not.
1. For cases where it is unclear consider the following:
a. Countable income is determined by taking the applicant’s gross income minus the
$20 General Disregard, the earned income disregard, and the cost of any private
health insurance premiums.
b. If a waiver recipient begins to receive income which would put them over 100%
FPL, then a deprivation review will be needed.
c. For households with more than one person, compare the verified countable
income to the limit for the appropriate household size.
d. For Spousal Impoverishment (SIMP) cases requesting waiver, the income of both
spouses is used to compare to the appropriate household size.
e. Some individuals may have a share of cost because their income is above the SSI
FBR, but will not be subject to deprivation because their income is below 100%
FPL.
f. For Assisted Living Waiver cases:
i. These budgets appear as Medically Needy (MN).
ii. First consider whether the individual was eligible in one of the exempt
categories.
• If so, then no deprivation review is needed.
iii. If it is a new application, then the worker must review the countable
income.
• If the countable income is below the 100% FPL, then no
deprivation review is needed.
NOTE: The individual may still have a SOC for their Assisted Living-Waiver (ALW) budget,
but for the deprivation review we look at their eligibility category.
REMINDER: If an applicant/client was eligible while living at home, would they have a
spenddown?
i. If the answer is yes, then a deprivation of resources review is needed.
ii. If the answer is no, then a deprivation of resources review is not needed and the
worker must move forward with referring the individual OR approving waiver
services.

Example 1: Jane Dough, age 72, has been living in her home, receiving Medicaid for the
past six years. She has income of $1107 per month. Jane recently began to
have mobility issues and needs assistance with her ADLs. She is looking at
assisted living facilities and is requesting waiver. Is a deprivation review
necessary?
Answer: No review is needed because her income is less than 100% FPL.
Example 2: Jane has moved into assisted living and loves all of the extra help that waiver
services provide. Her uncle, Plain Dough, recently passed away. Plain left
Jane an annuity that provides $500 per month in income for life. What next
steps are needed?
Answer: Verify the annuity information and submit it for review. If her
countable income has increased by $500/month, then a deprivation
review will be needed because her income has increased above
100% FPL.
Example 3: Ralph Roll, age 38, has been disabled for the last several years. He lives in
an apartment and receives $1200 per month in SSDI. He recently decided to
try working part-time for extra money. Ralph now earns $750 per month
from his job. The job is taking a toll, though. After his first month, Ralph
requests waiver services to get some additional help. Is a deprivation review
needed?
Answer: Refer Ralph to MIWD. If he is eligible for MIWD, then no
deprivation review is needed.
Example 4: Cathy Cake has submitted a Medicaid application. She is 80 years old, and
lives in assisted living. She is requesting waiver services because she has
several service needs. She receives $1400 in RSDI and a pension of $700
each month. Her savings had dropped to $3,000 due to the high cost of
assisted living. What next steps are needed?
Answer: Cathy will need a referral to begin the process of assessing her for
waiver. A deprivation review will also be needed because her
income is above 100% FPL.
Example 5: Brad Bread receives SSI. He has been living with a friend for the past few
years. Brad’s health has deteriorated lately, and he needs much more
assistance than his friend can provide. Brad has asked you about waiver
services and now wants to apply. His assessment shows that he meets the
Level of Care requirement. Is a deprivation review needed?
Answer: No deprivation review is needed. Brad is receiving SSI benefits
and is requesting waiver services.
MLTC PAS NEW 6/2025

Example 6: Brad receives waiver services for several months, but his health continues to
worsen. At the recommendation of his service provider, Brad has now moved
into a nursing facility. What are your next steps?
Answer: A deprivation review will be needed now that Brad has moved into
a medical facility.
Example 7: Cinnamon Twist is a disabled mother, living with her two children, who are
both in high school. She receives SSDI of $1550 per month and long-term
disability insurance of $400 per month. Cinnamon has been having
increasing difficulties with mobility lately and is now requesting waiver
services. Is a deprivation review needed?
Answer: No deprivation review is needed because her income is below
100% FPL for this household size.
Example 8: Cinnamon has now been receiving waiver services for the past year. Her
oldest son, Oliver, just graduated. He received a scholarship to the University
of Maine and will be moving there next month. What are your next steps?
Answer: If you confirm that her son has left, then a deprivation review will
now be required. Her income is more than 100% FPL after the
change to a household size of two.
Example 9: Peter Pastry has been eligible as a QI-1 for the past several years. You
receive a change report from the local hospital that he will be moving to
assisted living tomorrow. Waiver services have been requested, and it is
expected that he will meet the LOC. What are your next steps?
Answer: Peter Pastry’s income level is above 100% of the FPL and a
deprivation review will be needed prior to waiver services being
activated.
If a Medicaid case is identified as requiring a deprivation review it must be assigned to the
appropriate position number, unless the program case is already assigned to a Long-Term
Care (LTC) SSW. See Medicaid Position Numbers for Case Assignments.
When an applicant or participant is not currently residing in a specified living arrangement and
therefore not subject to a penalty period, and a transfer of assets is discovered or suspected, staff
must document details of the transfer in the case record.
Best practice is to add a narrative in the Deprivation sub-heading with a description and date of
the transfer and the verification date and source, if applicable.
Example 1: Applicant is not in a facility or requesting LTC services. The application
indicates a vehicle was sold within the last 60 months. Attestation is accepted
MLTC PAS NEW 6/2025



## Page 8

for eligibility, however a narrative including details listed on the application
about the transfer is entered in the Deprivation sub-heading.
Example 2: A renewal is completed for an ongoing client who is not currently in a facility
or requesting LTC services. AVS returns a flag on a known bank account.
Details about the AVS flag are documented in the Deprivation sub-heading.
Example 3: Agency receives a renewal form and bank statement from an ongoing client
who is not currently in a facility or requesting LTC services. The bank
statement provided shows several large checks written from the account. The
worker adds a Deprivation narrative including the dates of questionable
checks and the sequence number of the bank statement in document imaging.
General Information: The deprivation look back period is 60 months. Additional information
about deprivation and the look back period can be found at 23-003.04 to 003.04(L).
Deprivation that occurred during the look back period must be considered for new LTC
applicants as well as ongoing clients who are transitioning into institutional care. This also
applies to individuals in current pay SSI status and to minor children.
• For children’s waiver cases, ask the parent if the child had sold, traded, or given away
any assets in the look back period. If yes, request verification as needed. If no, this must
be documented in the case. There are no electronic data sources for the resources of a
minor. (A deprivation review will be needed prior to waiver services being activated.)
A penalty for the deprivation of resources cannot be imposed unless the individual is otherwise
eligible for Medicaid, except for the deprivation. If both spouses are applying and are otherwise
eligible, the period of ineligibility is divided equally between the spouses.
If a deprivation of resources has been determined, but not yet imposed (client has not been
noticed) then the client can withdrawal their waiver request and remain in a Medicaid
Spenddown budget.
If we have imposed the deprivation of resources penalty (client has been noticed) the client
cannot withdraw their waiver request and the deprivation penalty must remain and be served.
This results in their Medicaid case closing. Once the penalty period lapses the client may
reapply.
Per 23-003.04(A) A Deprivation of Resources is any action taken by the applicant or client, or
any other person or entity, which reduces or eliminates the applicant’s, client’s, or spouse’s
recorded ownership or control of the asset for less than fair market value (FMV).
1) The FMV of a resource at the time the resource was disposed of must be verified and the
equity value of the resource must be determined by taking into consideration any
encumbrances against the resource.
MLTC PAS NEW 6/2025



## Page 9

A deprivation of a resource includes, but is not limited to:
1) Recorded transfer of ownership of real property;
2) Not receiving the spousal share of an augmented estate;
3) Purchase of a life estate in another individual’s home without meeting the 12-month
requirement to reside there;
4) Promissory notes, loans, mortgages, and contract sales for less than fair market value or
which are for at least fair market value and are not enforced;
5) Purchase of an irrevocable, non-assignable annuity, if Medicaid is not the preferred
beneficiary and the annuity is issued on or after February 8, 2006;
6) Any transfer above the protected spousal reserved amount to a community spouse;
7) Purchase of any contract or financial instrument, including an endowment or insurance,
where the criteria for fair market value are not met;
8) Resources transferred to a pooled trust established for the benefit of a person 65 years old
or greater at the time of transfer; and
9) Transfer or gift of any resource to a third party for less than fair market value.
Regular tithing, charitable contributions, giving over time is generally not a deprivation if there
is a consistent pattern of this activity. However, any amount given with the apparent intent of
transferring assets to become Medicaid eligible is a deprivation. Policy review is required if
resource deprivation is unclear.
Any transfer that raises concern must be addressed and documented in the case for auditing
purposes. Critical thinking must be used to determine if a transfer meets the criteria of a
deprivation or if it’s reasonable to believe this is normal spending for the individual. Examples of
normal spending may include, but are not limited to:
Example 1: A bank statement shows ATM withdrawals of $600 most months. The worker
speaks with the client, who states she likes to pay her bills in cash. This
appears to be a reasonable explanation based on the lack of expense charges
in the account.
Example 2: Bank records show monthly transfers into another person’s account. The
worker speaks with the Power of Attorney (POA), who states this is the
client’s portion of their shared shelter expense. This appears to be reasonable
as the client and the POA share a residence, and the amount is not
questionable.
Example 3: A flag is indicated in AVS for a decrease in the checking account and the
worker requests bank statements for verification. Upon review, there is a
payment of $3500 to an unknown source as well as multiple out of state debit
card and ATM transactions. The worker reaches out to the Authorized
Representative and finds out the participant took a vacation to Florida. This is
a reasonable explanation of the account debits.
MLTC PAS NEW 6/2025



## Page 10

Example 4: Bank records show routine charitable contributions of $50 per week for the
last 2 years. This appears to be a consistent pattern of giving with no apparent
intent to transfer assets to become eligible for Medicaid.
Example 5: Bank statements show point of sale debits in the amount of $2100, $16,000,
and $8400 in the previous calendar year. The participant indicates these
were trips he made to nearby casinos, and he had no winnings. Upon further
review of the statements, the charge descriptions do appear to be similar to
local gaming establishments. This is a reasonable explanation of the
transfers.
Example 6: Bank statements show purchases made from a few stores and an online
merchant on a monthly basis ranging from $50 to $200 each. The worker
speaks with the client, who states she likes to shop for personal items,
clothing, etc. for herself on occasion. She also states she often stops at a
local restaurant and treats herself once she is done shopping as well. This is
a reasonable explanation of the account debits.
NOTE: When a transaction seems unusual, ask questions and document the findings in the case
narrative.
Transfers that are not considered a deprivation include: 23-003.04(K) and 003.04(L)
1) Transfer to the spouse, or a disabled or blind child;
2) Transfer to a POA/guardian/conservator for the applicant participant or their spouse’s
sole benefit;
3) Transfer to a trust solely for the benefit of someone 64 years of age or younger who is
disabled; and
4) Transfer of a home to certain relatives, if certain criteria are met and documented.
Workers may become aware of a deprivation in a few different ways (this list is not all-
inclusive):
1) Spousal Impoverishment (SIMP) Assessment - No application is on file however the
individual is in the process of completing an IM-73 with the agency.
a. Documentation of the SIMP assessment and details of what was found by the
worker regarding a deprivation of resources, or potential for deprivation, must be
included in the narrative. This information must be followed up on later if the
agency receives a Medicaid application for either spouse, if residing in LTC.
2) At initial application:
a. Information reported on the application or in verification received may provide a
lead that more information is necessary.
1. If the application states a resource has been sold, traded, or given away in
the previous 60 months.
2. If AVS returns flagged months. See AVS Procedural Guide
MLTC PAS NEW 6/2025



## Page 11

11
3. If AVS returns undisclosed property (these are sometimes displayed in
AVS as ‘currently owned’ when ownership has transferred).
a. Further follow-up may be needed regarding property that
is found by AVS:
i. The worker would need to check County
Assessor’s websites, etc. (Sometimes sold property
still shows in AVS).
4. If paper verification provided shows potential transfers (large checks
written, transfers to unknown accounts, large cash/ATM withdrawals).
b. Information provided during a call with the applicant or their representative.
3) At renewal application:
a. Information reported on the renewal form or in verification received may provide
a lead that more information is necessary.
1. If the renewal form states a resource has been sold, traded, or given away
in the previous 60 months.
2. If AVS returns flagged months. See AVS Procedural Guide
3. If AVS returns undisclosed property (these are sometimes displayed in
AVS as ‘currently owned’ when ownership has transferred).
4. If paper verification provided shows potential transfers (large checks
written, transfers to unknown accounts, large cash /ATM withdrawals).
b. Information provided during a call with the applicant or their representative.
c. A previously known resource is no longer being declared.
4) At change report:
a. Living arrangement change:
1. An ongoing client moves into a facility.
2. A request for waiver services has been received and/or a referral for
waiver LOC has been sent, which would constitute the need for the
deprivation review to begin. (A deprivation review will be needed prior to
waiver services being activated.)
3. An alert or change report is received indicating the client meets LOC for
waiver.
4. A request to open waiver is received.
b. Liquidation period
1. Property is reported as sold.
c. Property held in life estate is sold.
d. A known resource is reported sold, traded, or given away.
1. This includes non-countable vehicles.
5) Spousal Impoverishment (SIMP) specific: 477 NAC 26-003.02(D)
a. Although transfers between spouses is not generally considered a deprivation, if
the Medicaid spouse transfers assets to the community spouse, it must be
determined that this transfer did not result in the community spouse having
resources above their reserved amount, as indicated on the IM-73. Any amount
transferred over the reserved amount would be considered a deprivation.
MLTC PAS NEW 6/2025



## Page 12

12
b. The community spouse’s resources do not require verification annually after the
first renewal period for the Medicaid spouse. However, any known transfer of an
asset that was owned by the community spouse must be reviewed for FMV to see
if a deprivation exists. (This review would occur when a transfer of assets
becomes known to the agency).
1. This does not necessarily mean the community spouse must have assets
within the reserved amount. However, they are not allowed to transfer an
asset for less than FMV for the Medicaid spouse to maintain eligibility.
Look Back Period and Verification of Resources:
Resource Verification WINK-ed Resource Verification WINK-ed Resource Verification Q&A
Real Property Training Property Sold on Contract 477-000-031 Trust and Annuity Process Guide
The dates of the look back review period depend on the circumstances of the case: 23-003.04(G)
1) If it’s a new application and retroactive Medicaid was requested, the look back would
start from the oldest retroactive month requested.
2) If it’s a new application and retroactive Medicaid was not requested, the look back would
start with the application month.
3) For an ongoing client, the look back will begin with the month they went into LTC or
when they requested and met the criteria for LTC services (waiver or PACE, for
example).
Process to Verify Resources in the Look Back Period:
1) Review to determine if we have AVS consent as applicable.
a. If yes, submit an ad hoc request in AVS using the appropriate request type (RT) code
(NA or SA, as appropriate).
b. If no, contact the individual and/or spouse to obtain AVS consent using the Consent
Line and to obtain attested resource information, if needed.
1. If AVS consent and resource attestation is received, submit an ad hoc request in
AVS using the appropriate request type (RT) code (NA or SA, as appropriate).
2. If contact with the individual is unsuccessful the worker must send a VR
requesting the individual to contact Medicaid to provide consent to access
resource information electronically and gather additional resource information.
2) Continue to monitor and follow up on AVS results per the AVS Procedural Guide.
a. AVS will automatically search 60 months if the RT code is submitted as NA or SA.
1. If AVS shows flags indicating transfers that cannot be reasonably tied to facility
payments, bank statements for months surrounding the flags must be requested
and reviewed. During review, the worker must attempt to reconcile the
transferred amounts and review other leads to unreported resources, income, or
expenses.
2. If AVS does not return the full 60 months of records:
MLTC PAS NEW 6/2025



## Page 13

13
a) Review the application to determine if any transfers were attested to;
b) Review the case file (narrative, document imaging, etc.) to determine
if there are any leads to a transfer;
c) Review the records that were received in AVS to determine if there are
any flags present that are not reasonably tied to facility payments;
d) Document findings in a case narrative; and
e) Only request the additional months of bank statements that were not
returned by AVS if there is an indication that a deprivation occurred.
3) Review case narrative within the lookback period to determine if there was a transfer
noted.
4) Review address history in NFOCUS and SDX/BDE to determine if there was property
owned previously.
a. Review pertinent county assessor websites and follow up as needed.
5) Review previous budgets in NFOCUS, if applicable. Determine if there were any
previously owned assets (countable or not countable) to ensure FMV was received.
Example 1: The client owned a vehicle that was excluded for ABD budgeting and no
longer declares ownership.
Example 2: The client previously owned a life insurance policy with a cash value and
no longer declares ownership.
6) Review document imaging of financial accounts and other assets for leads to transfers.
7) Follow up on any flags or leads that indicate a transfer may have occurred. Document
findings in case narrative.
Documentation:
Details about deprivation findings must be documented in case narrative under the Deprivation
sub-heading when an individual is in a LTC arrangement, even when a penalty is not being
imposed.
1) If no deprivation is found, a narrative must be entered indicating the case was reviewed.
Any transfers that were questioned and resolved must be documented for auditing
purposes.
2) If deprivation is found, a narrative must be entered including the following details:
a. Description of transferred asset;
b. Date(s) of transfer;
c. Who the asset was transferred to;
d. Verification source;
e. Equity value transferred; and
f. Calculation used.

Deprivation Related to Life Estate:
1) Real Property Transfers with the Creation of Life Estate:
a. When a life estate is first created (within the look back period) the remainder
interest value of the property must be determined, as this is the value that was
transferred. Details about the transfer must be documented to include:
1. Assessed value of the property at the time the ownership was transferred,
and the life estate was created;
2. Mortgages or other liens subtracted from the assessed value;
3. Resulting equity value; and
4. Remainder value at the time of the transfer, calculated using the
remainder column of the Life Estate and Remainder Interest Table. This
value, minus any compensation received, would be used in the deprivation
calculation, if applicable.
b. To determine the remainder value, multiply the equity value by the corresponding
remainder interest from the chart, based on the age of the life tenant at the time of
creating the life estate.
Example: Client, age 83, transferred property to her children 2 years ago but
retained a life estate. The equity value of the property is $1 million. The penalty
would be $580,330 (remainder value at the time of transfer, age 81).
2) Sale of Property Held in Life Estate:
a. When an existing life estate interest is sold or transferred, the life tenant must
receive a lump sum of the FMV from the net proceeds. A life tenant is an individual
who possesses the right to use and benefit from a property for the duration of their
lifetime or for the life of another person designated in a life estate agreement. They
have the right to occupy, rent, or otherwise use the property, but they cannot sell or
transfer it outright.
b. Additional details about the sale or transfer must be documented to include:
1. Assessed value of the property at the time of the sale or transfer;
MLTC PAS NEW 6/2025



## Page 15

15
2. Mortgages or liens subtracted from the assessed value (or the sale price, if
greater than assessed value);
3. Resulting equity value; and
4. Individual’s life estate value at the time of the sale or transfer, calculated
using the life estate column of the chart at Life Estate and Remainder
Interest Table. This value, minus any compensation received, would be
used to determine if FMV was received by the life tenant.
c. To determine the life estate value, multiply the equity value by the corresponding
life estate interest from the chart, based on the age of the life tenant at the time of
the sale or transfer.
1. If the property is sold for less than FMV, the life tenant must receive
proceeds equal to their percentage of FMV.
2. Alternatively, the entire net proceeds could be placed into an investment
where the individual who had life tenancy receives all the income. 23-

Example: LTC client transferred property 10 years ago, retaining life
estate interest. The life estate is not a countable resource in determining
eligibility. At renewal, it’s stated the property has been sold. Client is 78
years old, and the equity value of the property was $200,000 at the time of
the sale.
• Client must receive at least $94,098 from the net proceeds to avoid
a penalty.
• Proceeds received are a countable resource to the client.
Period of Ineligibility:
To Calculate the Total Deprivation Amount:
1. Verify the fair market value (FMV) of the resource at the time the resource was disposed
of:
a. Verify and subtract any encumbrances or liens against the resource that reduced
the equity value;
b. Subtract any compensation received by the individual for the transfer;

c. If multiple deprivations exist, they must be added together for a total amount; and
d. This sum will be used to determine the period of ineligibility and penalty months,
as described in How to Determine the Length of the Penalty Period below.
NOTE: Details about the values, encumbrances and calculation used must be documented in the
case.
The period of ineligibility represents the amount of time the individual is not covered by
Medicaid, it is not a dollar amount the individual must pay before becoming Medicaid eligible.
23-003.04(H).
To Determine the Length of the Penalty Period:
1. Determine the monthly private rate for care. Call the facility to obtain the current daily
rate and multiply this by 30 (average days in the month).
2. Divide the total deprivation amount by the monthly private rate to determine the
length of the penalty.
a. If the deprivation results in a fraction, the fraction is converted to a dollar amount
(see step 4) and this amount is included as unearned income for the applicable
month.
3. Multiply the number of whole months from the length of penalty by the monthly
private rate to determine the whole month total.
4. Subtract the whole month total from the total deprivation amount to determine the
partial month penalty.
DEPRIVATION EXAMPLE: The total deprivation amount is $48,590 and the daily rate
at the facility is $285. See steps below for the calculations. In this example, there would
be 5 whole months of ineligibility, and $5,840 would be added as unearned income in the
6th month.
Ste p 1 - Multiply the daily private rate at Step 2 - Divide the total deprivation
the facility by 30. amount by the monthly private rate.
$285.00 (per day) $48,590.00 (total deprivation amount)
× 30 ÷ $8,550.00 (monthly private rate)
$8,550.00 = monthly private rate 5.6830 = length of penalty
Step 4 - Subtract the whole month total
Step 3 - Multiply the number of whole
from the total deprivation amount.
