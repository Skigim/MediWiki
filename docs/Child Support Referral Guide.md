# Child Support Referral Guide

## CHARTS Referral Requirements and Procedures for Medicaid Cases

### Overview

Individuals who assign their rights must cooperate in establishing paternity and obtaining medical support for themselves and those for whom they can legally assign rights. According to 42 CFR 433.147, a child support referral must be made for the Medicaid active parent when there is an absent or non-custodial parent of a dependent child, even if the child is not active in Medicaid. Child Support referrals must be made regardless of program category. This guide helps staff identify when a CHARTS referral should be made, how to enter it, and how to handle system limitations.

**CHARTS**: Children Have a Right to Support!

## Key Definitions

- **CHARTS**: Children Have a Right to Support - Nebraska's child support enforcement system
- **CP (Custodial Parent)**: Parent with whom the child primarily resides
- **CSE (Child Support Enforcement)**: Agency responsible for enforcing child support obligations
- **CSE-11**: Acknowledgment of Paternity form signed by parents to acknowledge paternity
- **Dependent**: Child for whom support is being sought
- **iCharts**: Interface system for viewing child support case information
- **NCP (Non-Custodial Parent)**: Absent parent who does not live with the child
- **SA/SG MED**: Subsidized Adoption/Subsidized Guardianship Medicaid
- **SOC (Share of Cost)**: Amount individual must pay before Medicaid coverage begins
- **Unknown NCP**: Designation used when the identity of the non-custodial parent is unknown

---

## Absent Parent Definitions

### Absent (Non-Custodial) Parents Include

Absent parents for CHARTS referral purposes include:

- **Biological parents**
- **Stepparents**
- **Adoptive parents**
- **Alleged fathers** (even if the name is unknown)
- **Deceased parents** when the deceased parent was a non-custodial parent at the time of death
  - A CHARTS referral is NOT made when the deceased parent was a member of the child's household at the time of death
- **Alleged parent who lives in the home** but paternity has not been established

---

## Paternity Establishment

### Legal Establishment vs. Medicaid Verification

This section refers to the legal establishment of paternity via Child Support Enforcement (CSE). This does NOT refer to Medicaid eligibility verification requirements.

- **Attestation of paternity** is only an acceptable verification source for Medicaid eligibility

### Methods of Legal Paternity Establishment

If the father's name is not on the birth certificate and the couple is unmarried, to legally establish paternity, the parents can either:

1. **Complete a notarized Acknowledgment of Paternity** as provided in Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1408.01
2. **Bring a civil proceeding** to establish paternity in district court as provided in Neb. Rev. Stat. § 43-1411

### CSE-11 Form

The CSE-11 is the Acknowledgment of Paternity that parents sign to acknowledge paternity.

**Important**: The CSE-11 must NOT be printed from the DHHS Forms website. This form is filled out and submitted by the household directly to Child Support.

## When CHARTS Referrals Are Required

### Required Referral Scenarios

A CHARTS referral must be sent in the following situations:

#### 1. Both Parent and Child Receiving Medicaid
When both the custodial parent and child are active Medicaid recipients.

#### 2. Parent Receiving Medicaid, Child Is Not
When only the parent is receiving Medicaid but the child is not.

**Note**: NFOCUS does not have the functionality to create a CSE referral in these situations. See the Workaround Procedures section.

#### 3. Married Parents, One Out of Household
When the parents of the child are still married, but one of them is out of the household (a Non-Custodial Parent). The Custodial Parent must be receiving Medicaid.

#### 4. Unknown Father/Mother
When a worker does not know who the father/mother of the child is, a referral needs to be made with Unknown NCP.

**Sources to check for father's name**:
- Vital Statistics (VSTATS) Interface
- Scanned Birth Certificate in Document Imaging (DI)
- CSE Interface (review iCharts for any current or previous child support cases)
- NFOCUS family relationships
- Scanned/e-applications under the child support section
- Other Master Cases (MCs) that the child has been in
- Previous narratives
- Phone call to the household to get the name of the NCP

**Important**: If you know the name of the father/mother, you must enter his/her name as the NCP. Do not enter Unknown NCP if this information is known.

#### 5. New Child Added to Medicaid
When a previous referral was sent and now a new child is born and added to Medicaid.

The Custodial Parent must be receiving Medicaid. A new referral is needed for the new child when they are added to the Medicaid program.

#### 6. Break in Service
When a program case closes and reopens (break in service).

A review of the CSE interface/iCharts must be made to determine if the Child Support case is still active. A new referral is not required if the CSE case is active, but a referral must be sent if new information has been provided.

#### 7. New Master Case Created
If a new MC is created, regardless of the program category, and the parent and child or only the parent are active in Medicaid, a referral must be made only if there is not already an active CSE case or referral on file.

#### 8. Child Moves in with Relative
When child moves in with a relative in a different master case. Two referrals would need to be made in this scenario since both parents are out of the household:

**Referral 1**:
- Custodial Parent: Relative
- Dependent: Child
- Non-Custodial Parent: Mother

**Referral 2**:
- Custodial Parent: Relative
- Dependent: Child
- Non-Custodial Parent: Father

#### 9. State Ward in Out-of-Home Placement
When child is a State Ward in out of home placement and not placed with a parent. Two referrals would need to be made in this scenario since both parents are out of the household:

**Referral 1**:
- Custodial Parent: State
- Dependent: Child
- Non-Custodial Parent: Mother

**Referral 2**:
- Custodial Parent: State
- Dependent: Child
- Non-Custodial Parent: Father

**Note**: NFOCUS does not have the functionality to create a CSE referral in these situations. See the Workaround Procedures section.

#### 10. Child with Relative Who Has Legal Custody/Guardianship
When child lives with a relative and that relative has legal custody/guardianship, and one of the parents is in the household and is receiving Medicaid.

Since the parent is in the household, he/she must be included in the unit per relative responsibility. A referral should be made with:
- Custodial Parent: Parent in the household
- Dependent: Child
- Non-Custodial Parent: Parent out of household

#### 11. Deceased Absent Parent
When the father or mother of the child is an absent/Non-Custodial Parent and out of the household at the time of their death.

A referral would need to be made since the father/mother was out of the household at the time of death. Child Support can enforce an order up to 2 years past the date of death. Staff do not need to make a referral if the NCP has been deceased for more than 2 years.

#### 12. Minor Mom Living with Major Mom
When minor mom has a child while living with major mom and is receiving Medicaid for that child and herself.

A referral is needed with:
- Custodial Parent: Minor mom
- Dependent: Her child
- Non-Custodial Parent: Father of child

#### 13. Minor Mom Independent
When minor mom has a child and is receiving Medicaid for her child and herself.

A referral is needed with:
- Custodial Parent: Minor mom
- Dependent: Her child
- Non-Custodial Parent: Father of child

#### 14. Subsidized Adoption/Subsidized Guardianship Cases
Referrals must be made for SA/SG Medicaid cases.

**Example 1**: When an individual is receiving SA/SG MED and gives birth (a referral is required for the newborn).

**Example 2**: When the parents of a child receiving SA/SG MED divorce and there is now an NCP (Custodial Parent must be receiving Medicaid).

**Note**: NFOCUS does not have the functionality to create a CSE referral in these situations. See the Workaround Procedures section.

#### 15. Share of Cost Met
If the parent has met the Share of Cost (SOC).

The referral would be sent at the time the SOC is met. If the individual has met their SOC and a referral has not yet been sent, one may be submitted at that time.

## Exceptions to CHARTS Referrals

### When Referrals Are NOT Required

CHARTS referrals are NOT required in the following situations:

1. **Only the child is receiving Medicaid** (parent not receiving Medicaid)
2. **An emancipated minor** (see 477 NAC 1-000 for definition)
3. **A child receiving Home & Community Based Services** in the home of both parents
4. **An unborn child**
   - No referral can be made until the child is born
5. **A deceased parent** when the parent was a member of the child's household at time of death
   - A CHARTS referral IS appropriate when the deceased parent was a non-custodial parent at the time of death
6. **599 CHIP cases** because there is no coverage for the mother

### Case Scenarios When Referrals Must NOT Be Sent

1. Minor mom is in her own MC with a new child and dad is in the household
2. Both parents live in the home with the child
3. Independent living program cases
4. Program cases that are reviewed and new budgets are run (e.g., no change reported)
5. The parent cannot meet the Share of Cost (SOC)

## How to Enter CHARTS Referrals

### Before Creating a Referral

Review the following to verify if a referral is needed:

- Check the NFOCUS CHARTS Referral List window to verify if a Referral Date is listed
  - If no date appears, the referral has not been sent
- Review the CSE interface/iCharts to determine if there is already an active Child Support case
  - A new referral is not required if a CSE case is active
  - A referral must be sent if new information has been provided

### CHARTS Referral Entry Steps

#### Step 1: Access CHARTS Referral Screen

From the Detail Master Case window, click on the Actions menu and choose CHARTS Referral.

#### Step 2: Check for Previous Referrals

Review the CHARTS Referral List screen to determine if a referral has previously been made for the individual or child.

If a referral was previously made, a new referral only needs to be sent if new information becomes known to the agency.

If no referral has previously been made, click on the green **New** button in the upper left-hand corner.

#### Step 3: Add Custodial Parent

On the CHARTS Referral Detail window, highlight the Custodial Parent in the Persons Known to Master Case area and click the **Custodial Party** button.

The Custodial Parent will move down into the CHARTS Referral List.

#### Step 4: Add Non-Custodial Parent (If Known)

**If the NCP is listed in Persons Known to Master Case**:
1. Highlight them in the Persons Known to Master Case area
2. Click on the **Non-Custodial Party** button
3. The Non-Custodial Parent will move down into the CHARTS Referral List
4. Highlight the child and click on the **Dependent** button
5. The child will move down into the CHARTS Referral List

**If the NCP is known but NOT listed in Persons Known to Master Case**:
1. Click the **Add Non-Custodial Party** button
2. Enter NCP information
3. Click on the **Perform Clearance** button
4. The Non-Custodial Parent will be added to the Persons Known to Master Case box
5. Highlight them and click on the **Non-Custodial Party** button
6. The Non-Custodial Parent will move down into the CHARTS Referral list
7. Highlight the child and click on the **Dependent** button
8. The child will move down into the CHARTS Referral List

#### Step 5: Handle Unknown NCP

If the Non-Custodial Parent is unknown:
1. Highlight the child
2. Choose the **Unknown NCP** box
3. This will allow you to then click on the **Dependent** button
4. The child will move down into the CHARTS Referral List

#### Step 6: Add Comments (If Needed)

Comments can be added to the CHARTS Referral by clicking on the **CHARTS Referral Comments/Narrative** button.

Comments can be helpful for the CSE worker to help determine the correct CP, NCP and Dependent.

**Use comments for**:
- Multiple alleged fathers (list other alleged fathers in comments)
- Additional information not captured in the referral fields
- Clarification about custodial arrangements

#### Step 7: Save and Submit

Click on the **Save** button and the CHARTS Referral will be submitted.

**Note**: If there is already an open CHARTS case, the worker will receive a message stating, 'CHARTS case already open'. The dependent will not be moved into the CHARTS Referral List area in the Charts Referral Detail window, and no referral will be created.

## Workaround Procedures

### When Email to CSE Intake Unit Is Required

At times, there may be system limitations to entering or submitting a CHARTS referral. An email workaround is required in these situations:

**System Limitation Scenarios**:
- SA/SG MED cases
- Situations when only the parent is active (not the child)
- State Ward cases where referrals cannot be entered in NFOCUS

**Error Correction Scenarios**:
- An error is discovered after sending the CHARTS referral (e.g., incorrect roles or the incorrect Dependent with the NCP)
- No assigned CSE worker information is available

### Email Procedure

**Before sending an email**: Check with a lead or supervisor to determine if the CHARTS referral can be entered in NFOCUS or an email is required.

**Email address**: dhhs.cseintakeunit@nebraska.gov

**Required information in email**:
- Master Case #
- Custodial Parent information
- Non-Custodial Parent information
- Dependent information
- Any other pertinent information on the case (e.g., corrected Dependent or NCP information on a previously submitted referral)

---

## Other Important Hints

### Multiple Children

If there is more than one child in the case and they all have the same custodial and non-custodial parents, only one submission listing all children is required. Do not make a separate submission for each child.

### Multiple Alleged Fathers

If multiple alleged fathers are identified, send only one referral and list the other alleged fathers in the Comments/Narrative of the referral. Child Support has access to the Document Imaging file and can access all documents needed; however, any additional information must be listed in the comment section of the referral.

### Existing CHARTS Cases

When a worker creates a new referral on a dependent, NFOCUS will check CHARTS to determine if there is an open CHARTS case which included that dependent, Custodial Parent, and Non-Custodial Parent (or Unknown Parent).

If there is an open CHARTS case, the worker will receive a message stating, 'CHARTS case already open'. That dependent will not be moved into the Charts Referral List box in the Charts Referral Detail window, and no referral will be created.

If there is new information on an existing CHARTS referral that needs to be communicated, see the Workaround Procedures section.

### Error Corrections

If an error is discovered after sending the CHARTS referral (e.g., incorrect roles or the incorrect Dependent with the NCP), notify the child support worker.

Review the CSE interface and iCharts system to see who the assigned child support worker is. If there is no worker assigned (e.g., the referral is brand new), see the Workaround Procedures section.

### New Information Requirements

A CSE referral must be entered on NFOCUS for new cases or when new information becomes known to the agency.
