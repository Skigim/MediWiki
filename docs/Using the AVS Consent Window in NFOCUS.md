## Key Definitions

- **AVS (Asset Verification System)**: Electronic system for verifying financial accounts and property
- **Non-Applicant Spouse**: A spouse who is not applying for Medicaid but whose resources must be verified
- **Non-MAGI**: Programs that include a resource test (ABD, HHA with resources, etc.)
- **Financially Responsible Spouse**: Spouse whose income/resources are counted in the applicant's eligibility determination

---

## When AVS Consent is Required

### Required for Resource-Tested Programs

AVS consent is **only required** to process applications for programs which include a resource test (Non-MAGI programs).

**AVS consent can be gathered** for other applicants but is not required for:
- MAGI programs
- Programs without resource tests

### Optional Collection

While not required for MAGI applicants, consent can still be gathered and recorded for future use if the individual later needs a Non-MAGI determination.

---

## Who Must Provide Consent

Consent must be gathered and recorded for:

1. **Adult applicants** to Non-MAGI programs
2. **Financially responsible spouse** if their spouse is not also applying for Medicaid

---

## Methods of Obtaining Consent

### Signed Medicaid Application

When someone has submitted and signed an application for Nebraska Medicaid, they have also consented to AVS.

**Married Couple Applications**: If a married couple applies for Nebraska Medicaid (both applying), then one signature from one of the spouses can serve as consent for both spouses.

### Non-Applicant Spouse Consent

If an individual is not applying for Nebraska Medicaid, but their spouse is applying, they will also need to consent to AVS. This can be accomplished through:

1. **Signing the Nebraska Medicaid Application** in the "Spouse of Applicant" field
2. **Signing the AVS Spouse Consent Form** (MLTC-45)
3. **Using the Consent Line** during a phone call between the worker and the individual (in lieu of obtaining the MILTC-63 supplemental application)

See the [MLTC Consent Line Process Guide](MLTC%20Consent%20Line%20Process%20Guide.md) for detailed consent line procedures.

## Recording Consent in NFOCUS

### What to Check

When using the AVS consent window, verify whether signatures were gathered for the appropriate individual.

**If the application or form was signed** by the appropriate person, their consent can be recorded in the AVS consent window.

### Consent Begin Date

The AVS consent begin date should be entered in NFOCUS using:
- Application received date, OR
- Form received date (as applicable)

### Duration of Consent

Once obtained, **consent remains in effect** unless the applicant rescinds their consent in writing.

### When to Review

The AVS consent window should be reviewed:
- When processing any initial application
- At renewal
- To ensure that consent has been properly recorded

---

## Non-Applicant Spouse Procedures

### If Spouse Fails to Sign

Should the non-applicant spouse fail to sign their spouse's application:

1. **Send the "Non-Applicant Spouse Consent Form" (MLTC-45)** to gather consent
2. **Do not submit spouse to AVS** until this consent is gathered
3. **Failure to provide consent** will result in closure for "Failed to Provide Information"

### Important Notes

- The non-applicant spouse **cannot be submitted to AVS** without proper consent
- Only the applicant can be denied/closed for failure to provide—the non-applicant spouse is not the recipient of benefits
