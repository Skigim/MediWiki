Disability Review for Children
A person who is disabled may be eligible for Medicaid in Nebraska based on their circumstances.
Nebraska Medicaid also has services available to allow individuals to remain in their homes or
communities. These services are often called “waiver” services. Waiver services may be provided to
individuals who meet specific criteria.
For purposes of Nebraska Medicaid, disabled is defined as meeting the disability criteria established
by the Social Security Administration. Sometimes the Social Security Administration (SSA) will make
this determination. If SSA has not made a determination, the State Review Team (SRT) can. The SRT
uses the same criteria as the SSA to determine if a person is disabled.
An individual’s disability status has to be re-reviewed regularly. Nebraska Medicaid will let you know
when it is time to re-review your child’s case.
As a parent or guardian, your responsibility in the disability determination process is to:
(1) Make sure your child has been recently seen by the healthcare provider (MD, DO, APRN,
CNP, or PA) who best knows your child’s disability.
(2) Ask the healthcare provider to fill out the DM-5 form, which tells Nebraska Medicaid about
their disability
(3) Ask your child’s healthcare provider to send the completed DM-5 form to Nebraska
Medicaid, along with medical records from the last 12 months to support their disability
(4) Ensure the DM-5 form and supporting medical records are submitted by the deadline in
the Verification Request
NOTE: If the above requested information is not provided, the SRT cannot review the case.
The SRT will not examine your child. The SRT will review the completed DM-5 form and the supporting
medical records provided to Nebraska Medicaid by your child’s healthcare providers. Based on this
information, the SRT will determine if your child meets the disability criteria.
Nebraska Medicaid will send you a written notice informing you of the decision. This notice will include
information about your appeal rights.
