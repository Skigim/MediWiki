# Medical Documentation Guide for Parents and Guardians
*Disability Review Documentation Requirements for Children's Medicaid*

## Overview

This guide provides essential information for parents and guardians about the disability review process and documentation requirements for children receiving or applying for Medicaid. A person who is disabled may be eligible for Medicaid in Nebraska based on their circumstances. Nebraska Medicaid also has services available to allow individuals to remain in their homes or communities, often called "waiver" services, which may be provided to individuals who meet specific criteria.

For purposes of Nebraska Medicaid, disabled is defined as meeting the disability criteria established by the Social Security Administration (SSA). Sometimes the SSA will make this determination. If SSA has not made a determination, the State Review Team (SRT) can. The SRT uses the same criteria as the SSA to determine if a person is disabled.

## Purpose & Process

### Why Disability Review is Needed

An individual's disability status has to be re-reviewed regularly. Nebraska Medicaid will let you know when it is time to re-review your child's case.

### Who Determines Disability

**Social Security Administration (SSA):**
- May make disability determination
- If SSA has made determination, that is used for Medicaid

**State Review Team (SRT):**
- If SSA has not made a determination, the SRT can
- Uses the same criteria as SSA to determine disability
- Reviews medical documentation without examining your child

## Section 1: Your Responsibilities as Parent or Guardian

As a parent or guardian, your responsibility in the disability determination process is to complete four essential steps:

### Step 1: Ensure Recent Healthcare Visit

Make sure your child has been recently seen by the healthcare provider who best knows your child's disability.

**Qualified Healthcare Providers:**
- MD (Medical Doctor)
- DO (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine)
- APRN (Advanced Practice Registered Nurse)
- CNP (Certified Nurse Practitioner)
- PA (Physician Assistant)

**Important:** Choose the provider who has the most knowledge about your child's specific disability and how it affects them.

**Recent Visit Recommended:**
- Schedule appointment if child hasn't been seen recently
- Provider needs current knowledge of child's condition
- Recent visit ensures up-to-date medical information

### Step 2: Request DM-5 Form Completion

Ask the healthcare provider to fill out the DM-5 form, which tells Nebraska Medicaid about their disability.

**What the DM-5 Form Does:**
- Provides detailed information about your child's disability
- Documents how the disability affects your child's daily functioning
- Describes your child's limitations and needs

**Provider's Role:**
- Complete the form based on their medical knowledge of your child's condition
- Provide specific details about your child's limitations
- Document the severity and expected duration of the disability
- Consider developmental factors appropriate for child's age

### Step 3: Request Form and Records Submission

Ask your child's healthcare provider to send the completed DM-5 form to Nebraska Medicaid, along with medical records from the last 12 months to support their disability.

**What to Include:**
- Completed DM-5 form
- Medical records from the last 12 months
- Records should specifically relate to your child's disability
- May include therapy records, IEP/IFSP if applicable

**Where to Send:**

Your child's healthcare provider can send documents to the State Review Team any of the following ways:
- **Internet:** www.accessnebraska.ne.gov
- **Email:** DHHS.ANDICenter@Nebraska.gov
- **Fax:** 402-742-2351
- **In person:** Drop off at a local DHHS office

### Step 4: Ensure Timely Submission

Ensure the DM-5 form and supporting medical records are submitted by the deadline in the Verification Request.

**Critical Deadline:**
- The Verification Request will specify the deadline
- Missing the deadline may result in denial or delay of services
- Follow up with your child's provider to confirm they sent the documents

**Your Follow-Up Responsibility:**
- Contact provider's office to confirm they received your request
- Ask when documents will be sent
- Verify documents were submitted before deadline
- Keep copy of Verification Request for your records

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If the above requested information is not provided, the SRT cannot review the case.

## Section 2: What the State Review Team Does

### SRT Review Process

**The SRT will NOT examine your child.**

Instead, the SRT will:
1. Review the completed DM-5 form
2. Review the supporting medical records provided by your child's healthcare providers
3. Determine if your child meets the disability criteria based on this documentation

### Documentation-Based Decision

The SRT bases its decision entirely on the written documentation provided. This is why it is critical that:
- Your child's healthcare provider completes the DM-5 form thoroughly
- Medical records clearly document your child's disability
- Records are from the last 12 months
- All documentation is submitted by the deadline

### What the SRT Looks For

The SRT reviews your child's medical documentation to determine if their condition meets the disability criteria established by the Social Security Administration, including:
- Severity of your child's medical condition
- How the condition limits your child's ability to function
- Developmental delays or impairments
- Expected duration of the condition
- Medical evidence supporting the diagnosis
- Treatment history and response to treatment
- Impact on age-appropriate activities

### Special Considerations for Children

The SRT uses childhood disability criteria which considers:
- Age-appropriate developmental milestones
- Impact on learning and development
- Functional limitations compared to same-age peers
- Need for special education or therapy services
- Family and environmental factors

## Section 3: Decision and Appeal Rights

### Written Notice

Nebraska Medicaid will send you a written notice informing you of the decision.

**The Notice Will Include:**
- Whether your child's disability has been approved or denied
- The basis for the decision
- Information about your appeal rights
- Important dates and deadlines

### Appeal Rights

The notice will include information about your appeal rights.

**If You Disagree with the Decision:**
- You have the right to appeal on behalf of your child
- Appeal instructions and deadlines will be in the notice
- Follow the appeal process carefully to protect your child's rights
- You may want to seek assistance with the appeal process

### What to Do After Receiving Notice

**If Approved:**
- Continue to maintain medical care for your child's condition
- Keep Nebraska Medicaid informed of any changes
- Attend future disability reviews as scheduled
- Services may continue or begin based on approval

**If Denied:**
- Review the notice carefully to understand why
- Consider whether you want to appeal
- Gather additional medical documentation if needed
- Contact Nebraska Medicaid or legal assistance if you have questions
