# G-845 Immigration Documentation Process

## Electronic Submission of Immigration Documentation via VLP Interface

### Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for submitting electronic G-845 requests through the Verify Lawful Presence (VLP) interface in NFOCUS. The January 13, 2019 NFOCUS Interim Release eliminated the paper G-845 process and replaced it with an electronic process that includes creating a PDF to send immigration documentation. This streamlined process allows workers to verify lawful presence, request Cuban/Haitian entrant confirmation, and submit documentation for VAWA self-petitioners and Victims of Trafficking.
