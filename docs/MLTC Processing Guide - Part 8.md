## SIMP Renewal (Continued from Part 7)

### Step 10: Notices {#simp-notices}

• Generate and Send Notice of Action to individual(s).

- If completing a renewal and the individual remains eligible, ensure the [Medicaid Renewal Notice Language](Medicaid%20Renewal%20Notice%20Language.md) is included on the notice.
- If a notice is generated for "Failed to Provide Information", staff may communicate missing information.

---

### Step 11: Information Provided Within 90 Days of Application on Denied Case {#simp-90-days}

• Determine if it is within the 90 days from the application date. If within 90 days and:

**All information / verifications are present:**
- Re-pend and process the same day

**If still unable to process:**
- Do not re-pend the case
- Send speed note stating what information / verifications are still needed

See [Changes Reported During 90 Day Redetermination Period](Changes%20Reported%20During%2090%20Day%20Redetermination%20Period.md) for further information on the process to take when a new change is reported during the 90 day redetermination period.

## Disability Application

**(Application Attests to Disability – No Determination)**

### Step 1: Begin {#disability-begin}

• Retrieve and accept the work task "Application Received".

• Application pended in Non-MAGI queue.

---

### Step 2: Check Application for Completeness {#disability-check-application}

• Check for a valid application: containing name, address and signature (see 477 NAC 3-005).

**Types of Applications that can be utilized for determining Non-MAGI eligibility:**

See the [Standalone Application Chart](Standalone%20Application%20Chart.md) for information on valid applications.

- **MILTC-64 application** (NO supplemental application needed); or,
  - This is a standalone application for AABD/Medicaid
  - Can be completed for applicants under age 65 who are disabled or applying for a disability determination; or an applicant over age 65
  - Can only be used for families in which all members are elderly and/or disabled

- **Online or Phone application - HCNE/HCPH** (NO supplemental needed); or,

- **Federal online application – HCMP** AND the supplemental application (MILTC-63); or,

- **MILTC-53** AND the supplemental application (MILTC-63)

**Confirm applicant age between 18 and 65:**
- AABD Disability begins at age 18 and ends the month of age 65
- If individual is age 18, need to see if MAGI eligible while Disability is pending

**If application is valid:**
- Go to Step 3 in this section

**If application is not valid:**
- Take appropriate steps to obtain a valid application
- See [Valid Application Signature](Edge%20Cases%20%26%20Special%20Scenarios.md) for information on valid application signatures
- Utilize the [MLTC Consent Line Process Guide](MLTC%20Consent%20Line%20Process%20Guide.md) for applications missing a signature
- Attempt to contact individual by phone for follow-up if areas on the application are left blank or where clarification is needed. See [Unanswered Questions](Unanswered%20Questions.md) for further information

**Incarcerated Individuals:**

Applications must be accepted and Medicaid eligibility determined for individuals who are residing in a 24 hour facility that are being discharged either the month the application was submitted or the month after the application was submitted. Examples of these facilities include Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Centers, Regional Centers, Department of Corrections facilities, County Jails, and County Youth facilities.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The SUPPORT Act of October 2018 added a provision that applies to applications received for juveniles (defined as individuals under age 21 and individuals who may be eligible under [Former Foster Care](Former%20Foster%20Care%20Guide.md)). The state is required to accept and process applications for individuals up to age 26 at any point during their period of incarceration.

**Universal Staff Duties:**
- For any application received where an individual indicates they are incarcerated, staff must assign the case to the **INC ASSIST position number (66118075)**
- See [Medicaid Position Numbers for Case Assignments](Medicaid%20Position%20Numbers%20for%20Case%20Assignments.md) for further information

**Assigned Staff Duties:**
- Verification of the release date from the facility is required prior to processing the application
- Verifications can be provided from staff at the facility
- The assigned worker will also need to know where the individual will be residing upon discharge, household composition, tax household information, and verification of income of any individual who would be financially responsible for the client based on the tax filing status

### Step 3: Disability Determination {#disability-determination}

• Review electronic interfaces and data on file for disability determination:

- Bendex/BDE (Social Security)
- SDX (SSI)
- Verification of disability in Document Imaging (DI)

• Review for eligibility in the appropriate Medicaid category. See [ABD or HHA Process Flow](ABD%20or%20HHA%20Process%20Flow.md) for further information.

**If applicant is ineligible in a MAGI category and:**

- **Has a current disability:** move forward with a Non-MAGI determination. See Step 5 in this section.
- **No disability has been determined:** move to Step 4 in this section.
- **Is denied by SSI for severity:**
  - Deny Medicaid case (even under appeal); and,
  - Narrate if they win the appeal Medicaid will be retroactive to that date
- **Is denied by SSI for duration:**
  - Consider for referral to Economic Assistance for State Disability Program; and,
  - Narrate if they win the appeal Medicaid will be retroactive to that date

• If applicant has won a disability appeal decision, check for Medicaid applications that have been filed back to the original disability date. Change the application received date to the oldest possible date.

---

### Step 4: Confirm SSA Application or SSA Status if No Disability Determination Has Been Made {#disability-ssa-confirm}

• Determine if the applicant has filed for disability:

- SDX match on pending application; or
- Have verification of RSDI application made

• Review for situations where you would consider MAGI Expansion eligibility or go directly to the State Review Team without waiting for disability determination. Refer to [ABD or HHA Process Flow](ABD%20or%20HHA%20Process%20Flow.md) and the [SRT Process Guide](SRT%20Process%20Guide.md) for further information.

**For applicants who are not appropriate for either SRT or SDP, and have no disability application pending:**

- Deny the applicant using the reason "Eligibility Requirements Not Met"
- In the comment section of the notice, inform the applicant that eligibility for disability is made through Social Security. Ask the individual to make application with Social Security and then re-apply for Medicaid at that time

**Once it is determined the applicant has filed and is pending determinations:**

- Place into **position number: 27906498**
- See [Medicaid Position Numbers for Case Assignments](Medicaid%20Position%20Numbers%20for%20Case%20Assignments.md) for further information

---

### Step 5: Process the Budget {#disability-budget}

• When notified of approval (alert) from interfaces, take the following steps:

**If applicant is found eligible for SSI (SDX interface):**
- Resources and income have already been checked and processed
- Open the Medicaid case from that pending month

**If applicant is receiving SSA disability (BDE interface):**
- Verify resources and income
- Process the budget

---

### Step 6: Clear Alerts/Work Tasks {#disability-clear-alerts}

• Process and clear any alerts and work tasks on the case.

---

### Step 7: Notices {#disability-notices}

• Generate and Send Notice of Action to individual(s).

- If completing a renewal and the individual remains eligible, ensure the [Medicaid Renewal Notice Language](Medicaid%20Renewal%20Notice%20Language.md) is included on the notice.
- If a notice is generated for "Failed to Provide Information", staff may communicate missing information.

---

### Step 8: Narrate {#disability-narrate}

• Narrate – include information that explains the actions taken in a way that others can follow the work completed on the case.

**PROCESS COMPLETE**

---

## Share of Cost (SOC)

### Step 1: Medical Need {#soc-medical-need}

• Evaluate for medical need that exceeds the Share of Cost.

- Contact the individual and ask if they want to be considered for SOC

**NOTE:** AD waiver and certain DD waiver (DDAC, CDD, DDAD) cases are set to active Medicaid.

---

### Step 2: Pend {#soc-pend}

• If the individual says yes for SOC, re-pend the applicant (or the case depending on if there are any Medicaid eligible household members).

- Determine if a supplemental application is needed

---

### Step 3: Follow Verification Plan {#soc-verification}

• Refer to the [AVS Procedural Guide](AVS%20Procedural%20Guide.md) and the Medicaid [Resource Verification](Resource%20Verification.md) Plan and the Resource Verification WINK-ed.

• Send Verification Request Form (VR) to applicant for other resource types if necessary.

---

### Step 4: Determine Eligibility {#soc-eligibility}

• Update NFOCUS and determine eligibility.

**NOTE:** If the participant has earnings from employment or self-employment and is otherwise eligible for Medicaid, except for income, review the [MIWD Eligibility Process Guide](MIWD%20Eligibility%20Process%20Guide.md) prior to approval.

---

### Step 5: Change Medical Category {#soc-category}

• Change medical category (MAGI, NON-MAGI, Combined).

---

### Step 6: Notices {#soc-notices}
