## Initial Application Denials

### 90-Day Grace Period

When a Medicaid application is denied for failure to provide information, an individual has **90 days from the application date** to provide the necessary information without requiring a new application.

### Processing Duplicate Applications During 90-Day Period

During this 90-day period, if a household submits an application:

1. **Review the application for changes**
   - Check if any household circumstances have changed
   - Identify any new information reported

2. **Contact the household**
   - Inform them about the status of their original application
   - Explain the 90-day timeframe

3. **Inform about outstanding verifications**
   - Tell the household what items are still needed
   - Specify when their 90 days will end
   - Clarify the date by which information must be received

### Verification Timing

**If verifications are received within the 90-day timeframe**:
- The case will be processed utilizing the **original application**
- No new application is required
- Process with the original application date

**If verifications are received after the 90-day timeframe**:
- The household will need to submit a **new application**
- The original application cannot be used
- Processing begins with the new application date

### Important Exception

**If an application is denied for not meeting an eligibility requirement** (not for failure to provide information):
- A **new application is needed** regardless of timing
- The 90-day grace period does not apply
- Examples: over income, not a qualified non-citizen, not meeting categorical requirements

## Closed Case Applications

### 90-Day Timeframe After Closure

When a case is closed and an application is received **within 90 days of the closure date**, special processing rules apply.

### Processing Steps

1. **Review the application for changes**
   - Check if any household circumstances have changed since closure
   - Identify any new information reported

2. **Contact the household**
   - Inform them regarding the status of their case
   - Explain that their case can be reopened

3. **Request outstanding information**
   - Inform the household of what items are needed
   - Specify when their 90-day timeframe will end
   - Clarify the deadline for providing information

### Reopening vs. New Application

**If necessary items are provided during the 90-day timeframe**:
- The case will be **reopened**
- No new application is required
- Eligibility continues from the closure date or appropriate effective date

**If necessary items are provided after 90 days of closure**:
- The household will need to submit a **new application**
- The case cannot be reopened
- Processing begins with the new application date

## Active Case Applications

### When Applications Are Received on Active Cases

When an application is received on an active case, the application should be processed differently since the case is already open.

### Processing Steps

1. **Review the application for changes**
   - Check for any reported changes in circumstances
   - Identify requests to add a person to the Medicaid case

2. **Process reported changes**
   - Any reported changes should be acted upon per the process guides
   - Follow change reporting procedures
   - Update budgets and eligibility as appropriate

3. **Process requests to add persons**
   - Follow procedures for adding household members
   - Determine eligibility for new persons
   - Update the case composition

4. **Notify the household**
   - Inform them regarding the status of their case
   - Explain that their case is already active
   - Confirm receipt of any changes or add requests

### No New Application Required

Since the case is already active:
- The duplicate application serves as a change report or add request
- Process the changes using existing procedures
- No new application determination is needed

---

## 90-Day Timeframe Rules

### Calculating the 90-Day Period

**For denied initial applications**:
- Count 90 days from the **application date**
- This is the date the application was received by the agency

**For closed cases**:
- Count 90 days from the **closure date**
- This is the date the case was terminated

### What the 90-Day Period Allows

During the 90-day timeframe:
- Individuals can provide missing information
- The original application can still be used
- Cases can be reopened without a new application
- Eligibility can be established with the original application date

### After the 90-Day Period Expires

After 90 days have passed:
- A new application is required
- The original application cannot be used
- Cases cannot be reopened based on the old application
- Processing begins fresh with the new application date

### Exceptions to the 90-Day Rule

The 90-day grace period **does NOT apply** when:
- The application was denied for not meeting an eligibility requirement (not for failure to provide information)
- The household is ineligible for categorical or financial reasons
- A new eligibility determination is needed due to changed circumstances
