# Medical Documentation Guide for Members
*Disability Review Documentation Requirements for Medicaid Applicants and Recipients*

## Overview

This guide provides essential information for Medicaid applicants and recipients about the disability review process and documentation requirements. A person who is disabled may be eligible for Medicaid in Nebraska based on their circumstances. Nebraska Medicaid also has services available to allow individuals to remain in their homes or communities, often called "waiver" services, which may be provided to individuals who meet specific criteria.

For purposes of Nebraska Medicaid, disabled is defined as meeting the disability criteria established by the Social Security Administration (SSA). Sometimes the SSA will make this determination. If SSA has not made a determination, the State Review Team (SRT) can. The SRT uses the same criteria as the SSA to determine if a person is disabled.

## Purpose & Process

### Why Disability Review is Needed

An individual's disability status has to be re-reviewed regularly. Nebraska Medicaid will let you know when it is time to re-review your case.

### Who Determines Disability

**Social Security Administration (SSA):**
- May make disability determination
- If SSA has made determination, that is used for Medicaid

**State Review Team (SRT):**
- If SSA has not made a determination, the SRT can
- Uses the same criteria as SSA to determine disability
- Reviews medical documentation without examining you

## Section 1: Your Responsibilities

Your responsibility in the disability determination process is to complete four essential steps:

### Step 1: Visit Your Healthcare Provider

Visit your healthcare provider who best knows your disability.

**Qualified Healthcare Providers:**
- MD (Medical Doctor)
- DO (Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine)
- APRN (Advanced Practice Registered Nurse)
- CNP (Certified Nurse Practitioner)
- PA (Physician Assistant)

**Important:** Choose the provider who has the most knowledge about your specific disability and how it affects you.

### Step 2: Request DM-5 Form Completion

At your visit, ask your healthcare provider to fill out the DM-5 form.

**What the DM-5 Form Does:**
- Tells Nebraska Medicaid about your disability
- Provides detailed information about your condition
- Documents how your disability affects your daily functioning

**Provider's Role:**
- Complete the form based on their medical knowledge of your condition
- Provide specific details about your limitations
- Document the severity and expected duration of your disability

### Step 3: Request Form and Records Submission

Ask your healthcare provider to send the completed DM-5 form to Nebraska Medicaid, along with medical records from the last 12 months to support your disability.

**What to Include:**
- Completed DM-5 form
- Medical records from the last 12 months
- Records should specifically relate to your disability

**Where to Send:**

Your healthcare provider can send documents to the State Review Team any of the following ways:
- **Internet:** www.accessnebraska.ne.gov
- **Email:** DHHS.ANDICenter@Nebraska.gov
- **Fax:** 402-742-2351
- **In person:** Drop off at a local DHHS office

### Step 4: Ensure Timely Submission

Ensure the DM-5 form and supporting medical records are submitted by the deadline in the Verification Request.

**Critical Deadline:**
- The Verification Request will specify the deadline
- Missing the deadline may result in denial or delay
- Follow up with your provider to confirm they sent the documents

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If the above requested information is not provided, the SRT cannot review the case.

## Section 2: What the State Review Team Does

### SRT Review Process

**The SRT will NOT examine you.**

Instead, the SRT will:
1. Review the completed DM-5 form
2. Review the supporting medical records provided by your healthcare providers
3. Determine if you meet the disability criteria based on this documentation

### Documentation-Based Decision

The SRT bases its decision entirely on the written documentation provided. This is why it is critical that:
- Your healthcare provider completes the DM-5 form thoroughly
- Medical records clearly document your disability
- Records are from the last 12 months
- All documentation is submitted by the deadline

### What the SRT Looks For

The SRT reviews your medical documentation to determine if your condition meets the disability criteria established by the Social Security Administration, including:
- Severity of your medical condition
- How your condition limits your ability to function
- Expected duration of your condition
- Medical evidence supporting the diagnosis
- Treatment history and response to treatment

## Section 3: Decision and Appeal Rights

### Written Notice

Nebraska Medicaid will send you a written notice informing you of the decision.

**The Notice Will Include:**
- Whether your disability has been approved or denied

- Important dates and deadlines

### Appeal Rights

The notice will include information about your appeal rights.

**If You Disagree with the Decision:**
- You have the right to appeal
- Appeal instructions and deadlines will be in the notice
- Follow the appeal process carefully to protect your rights
- You may want to seek assistance with the appeal process

### What to Do After Receiving Notice

**If Approved:**
- Continue to maintain medical care for your condition
- Keep Nebraska Medicaid informed of any changes
- Attend future disability reviews as scheduled

**If Denied:**
- Review the notice carefully to understand why
- Consider whether you want to appeal
