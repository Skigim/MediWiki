Disability Review for Children
A person who is disabled may be eligible for Medicaid in Nebraska based on their circumstances.
Nebraska Medicaid also has services available to allow individuals to remain in their homes or
communities. These services are often called “waiver” services. Waiver services may be provided to
individuals who meet specific criteria.
For purposes of Nebraska Medicaid, disabled is defined as meeting the disability criteria established
by the Social Security Administration. Sometimes the Social Security Administration (SSA) will make
this determination. If SSA has not made a determination, the State Review Team (SRT) can. The SRT
uses the same criteria as the SSA to determine if a person is disabled.
An individual’s disability status has to be re-reviewed regularly. Nebraska Medicaid will let your patient’s
parent or guardian know when it is time to re-review their case.
Your patient’s parent or guardian’s responsibility in the disability determination process is to:
(1) Take their child to their healthcare provider (MD, DO, APRN, CNP, or PA)
(2) At their child’s visit, ask you to fill out the DM-5 form, which tells Nebraska Medicaid about
their disability
(3) Ask you to send the completed DM-5 form to Nebraska Medicaid, along with medical
records from the last 12 months to support their disability.
You may submit medical records by:
• Internet: iserve.nebraska.gov
• Email: DHHS.ANDICenter@nebraska.gov
• Fax: 402-742-2351
• Mail: PO BOX 2992, Omaha, NE 68172-9659
• In person: dropping off at a local DHHS office
(4) Ensure the DM-5 form and supporting medical records are submitted by the deadline in
the Verification Request
NOTE: If the above requested information is not provided, the SRT cannot review the case.
The SRT will not examine your patient. The SRT will review the completed DM-5 form and the
supporting medical records provided to Nebraska Medicaid by you. Based on this information, the SRT
will determine if your patient meets the disability criteria.
“Helping People Live Better Lives” | pg. 1


Nebraska Medicaid will send your patient’s parent or guardian a written notice informing them of the
decision. This notice will include information about their appeal rights.
The following is a list of examples of medical documentation from the last 12 months your office can
send to Nebraska Medicaid, along with the completed DM-5 form. These are examples of the medical
documentation that Nebraska Medicaid finds helpful in making the disability determination for your
patient. Please feel free to send additional medical records that you think would be helpful for this
review.
