## Additional Applications and Forms

### MILTC-51 (Extra Persons Form)
The MILTC-51 needs to be given if the household is completing an MILTC-53 and there are more than two people in the household.

**Requirement**: One MILTC-51 form needs to be given for each additional person in the household.

### MILTC-63 (Supplemental Application)
May be used, if required, in conjunction with the MILTC-53, MILTC-64, HCMP, Phone/Online, LIS applications and renewal forms to obtain:
- Resource information
- AVS consent if none are present

**Important**: The MILTC-63 is **not a standalone application** - it must be paired with a valid application.

### MLTC-45 (Non-Applicant Spousal Consent)
Would need to be sent to capture AVS consent of a non-applicant spouse if they failed to sign the MILTC-64 or renewal form.

**Note**: The MLTC-45 is not used to capture AVS consent for the applicant—only for non-applicant spouses.

## Obtaining Missing Information

### Best Practice Approach

The worker can **attempt to make a call out to the household** and obtain their attested resources before sending paper forms.

**AVS consent** for the applicant and spouse (as applicable) can also be obtained verbally by using the [Consent Line](MLTC%20Consent%20Line%20Process%20Guide.md).

### When Call Out is Successful

If information is obtained via phone call, the MILTC-63 does not need to be sent.

### When Call Out is Unsuccessful

These steps must be taken **prior to sending an MILTC-63**:
1. Attempt phone contact
2. Document attempt in case narrative
3. Send MILTC-63 only if unable to reach household
