## Key Definitions

- **AVS (Asset Verification System)**: Electronic system for verifying financial accounts and property ownership
- **Waiver Services**: Long-term care services provided in home or community settings
- **Processing**: Determining Medicaid eligibility and approving benefits
- **Gap in Coverage**: Break in Medicaid benefits that could interrupt services

---

## AVS Wait Time Exception Criteria

The exception to the AVS wait time is only applied when **AVS is the only step preventing immediate processing**. The exception must be documented in the case narrative.

### Approved Exception Circumstances

✓ **Waiver Coverage Gap Prevention** - The client is currently receiving waiver services, and failure to process the renewal within the current month will result in a gap in coverage
  - Applies when the case has closed (or is set to close)
  - Failing to process before the end of the month will cause an interruption in waiver services
  - Exception should NOT be applied to renewals with no break in coverage

✓ **Hospital to Institutional/Home Transfer** - The client indicates they are in a hospital and need to transfer to:
  - Nursing home
  - Assisted living facility with waiver services
  - Back to home with waiver services

✓ **Nursing Home/Rehabilitation Transfer** - The client indicates they are in a nursing home/rehabilitation facility and need to transfer to:
  - Assisted living facility with waiver services
  - Back to home with waiver services

✓ **Assisted Living Waiver Request** - The client indicates they are in an assisted living facility and are requesting waiver services

✓ **QI-1 Medical Need** - For ongoing QI-1 clients who now have a medical need, if waiting for AVS would delay processing to the next month

✓ **Other Circumstances** - For any other reason, send a question to [DHHS.MedicaidPolicyQuestions@nebraska.gov](mailto:DHHS.MedicaidPolicyQuestions@nebraska.gov) asking for an exception to the wait time for AVS

## Documentation Requirements

When using the expedited AVS exception, workers must:

1. **Document in narrative** - The specific reason for the exception must be clearly documented in the case narrative
2. **Submit to AVS** - Client information must still be submitted to AVS even if processing early
3. **Review results** - AVS results should be reviewed with appropriate action taken, as necessary, after AVS returns

---

## Resource Verification Requirements

**Important**: If omitting the AVS wait time, resources must still be verified through another means.

Alternative verification methods may include:
- Bank statements
- Property records
- Vehicle registrations
- Other collateral documentation

Refer to the [Resource Verification](Resource%20Verification.md) guide and [AVS Procedural Guide](AVS%20Procedural%20Guide.md) for additional verification methods.
