# Unanswered Questions

**Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services | Medicaid & Long-Term Care**

## Overview

At times valid applications (name/address/signature) or renewal forms are provided without answers to several or all questions. This document provides the process for addressing unanswered or incomplete questions on Medicaid applications and renewal forms. The key principle is to avoid sending a verification request with everything checked off - instead, follow a targeted approach to obtain only necessary information.

## Key Definitions

**Valid Application:** An application containing name, address, and signature. An application can be valid even if questions are left unanswered.

**Verification Request (VR):** A formal request sent to the client asking for specific information or documentation needed to complete an eligibility determination.

**Eligibility Determination:** The process of reviewing all information to decide whether an individual qualifies for Medicaid benefits.

**Failure to Provide:** A denial or closure reason used when the household fails to respond to a verification request by the due date.

## Process for Addressing Unanswered Questions

### Step 1: Determine if Missing Information is Needed

Determine if the missing information is needed in order to complete an eligibility determination. **Follow up is required on:**

**a. Questions relevant to the Medicaid eligibility determination**

**b. Responses that conflict with information currently known to the agency**

### Step 2: Attempt a Telephone Call

Attempt a telephone call to the client to obtain the needed information.

#### If the Call is Successful:

1. **Explain the reason for the call** and review the missing information
2. **Document the information in detail** in the case narrative
3. **If the information obtained from the client requires additional verification:**
   - Inform the client a Verification Request (VR) will be sent requesting the needed information

#### If the Call is Unsuccessful:

1. **Document the attempted phone call** in the case narrative
2. **Send a VR for the missing information**
   - Include a note on the VR informing the client they may call the agency to discuss the missing information, or they may provide a written statement with their answers
   - Choose **'Other'** and note what information is missing in the comments
   - **Unless you are requesting clarification on known income or resources, do NOT select specific items** in the verification selection

**Sample VR Wording:**
```
We received your application for Medicaid. However, some questions on the 
application were left unanswered (see below). Answers to these questions are 
needed to determine eligibility. This information can be provided by calling 
XXX-XXX-XXXX or by providing a written statement.
```

### Step 3: Continue with Eligibility Determination

Once the relevant questions have been answered, continue with the Medicaid eligibility determination.

**Note:** A subsequent VR may be needed for additional verification, depending on the information received from the client.

### Step 4: Process Application or Renewal

When all information needed to determine eligibility has been received, process the application or renewal as normal.

**If the household fails to respond to the VR by the due date:**
- Deny or close the associated participant(s) for **'Failure to Provide'**

## Tips and Examples

### Tip 1: Ask if Information is Needed for Determination

Ask yourself if the information is needed in order to complete a Medicaid determination. **If the information would affect Medicaid eligibility, then an answer is needed.**

**Example A: Tax Household Questions on Non-MAGI Application**
- Client submits an MILTC-53 and MILTC-63 for a Non-MAGI Medicaid determination
- Does not answer any of the tax household questions
- **Follow-up:** NOT needed - Tax household information is not needed to make a Non-MAGI determination

**Example B: Other Income Question Left Blank**
- Client submits an MILTC-53 for themselves and their children
- Fails to answer the question regarding other income (question 29)
- **Follow-up:** NEEDED - The client may have income that would need to be counted in their budgets

### Tip 2: Blank Does Not Mean "No"

Remember that failure to answer a question does not indicate a 'no' response.

**Example A: Citizenship/Alien Status Questions**
- Client submits an application and leaves the citizenship/alien status questions blank
- **Do NOT interpret this to mean** the client is declaring that they are undocumented
- **Follow-up:** NEEDED - Obtain the attested status and information
- The same would apply if the TPL section was left blank without a yes or no

**Example B: Vehicles Question**
- Client submits an MILTC-53 and MILTC-63 for a Non-MAGI determination
- Leaves the table regarding vehicles (question 9) blank
- **Follow-up:** NEEDED - Determine whether or not the client has any vehicles

**Example C: Online Application Skipped Sections**
- Be aware of sections of the online application that were skipped by the client
- The online application indicates sections not completed by the client
- These sections may need follow-up

### Tip 3: Look for Partial Information

The client may have answered part of a question but not provided all the information that is needed.

**Example A: Tax Filing Status**
- Client indicated that they will file taxes and claim dependents
- Did not indicate who they will claim
- **Follow-up:** NEEDED - Obtain the names of the dependents

**Example B: Resources**
- Client only answered for some resource types and not others
- **Follow-up:** NEEDED - Follow-up on any resources left blank
- An interview is NOT a requirement for eligibility
- However, if you believe there may be a large amount of resources which will require clarification, a meeting can be scheduled to discuss, either by phone or in person
- **Important:** An individual cannot be denied for failing to call or appear at the meeting

### Tip 4: Use Best Judgment

Use your best judgment when making a determination on whether or not further information is needed.

**Always:**
- Document why you have requested more information
- Make sure you have sufficient information before processing
