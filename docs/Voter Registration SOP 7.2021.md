## Key Definitions

**Voter Registration:** The process of registering to vote in Nebraska elections. The Department must offer the opportunity to register during Medicaid application and renewal processes.

**FFM (Federally Facilitated Marketplace):** The federal health insurance marketplace application system. FFM applications do not include voter registration questions, so staff must proactively offer registration information.

**Narration:** Documentation in the case record of the individual's response to the voter registration offer and the action taken by staff.
