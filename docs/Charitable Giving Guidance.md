# Charitable Giving Guidance
*Policy Framework for Evaluating Bona Fide Charitable Donations in Long-Term Care Eligibility*

## Overview

This guide provides staff with comprehensive guidance for reviewing charitable giving transactions when determining Medicaid eligibility for long-term care services and supports. The Department has begun making allowances for bona fide charitable giving, representing a policy shift from previous practices where no allowance for giving was permitted, which resulted in deprivation of resource penalties.

New regulations are being drafted to give more structure to the deprivation review process. This interim guide provides a general framework for reviewing cases with charitable giving until the regulations can be published. The guide emphasizes a holistic review of giving patterns, donor intent, and contextual factors to distinguish genuine charitable activity from asset transfer intended to establish Medicaid eligibility.

**Document Date:** Updated June 2025  
**Scope:** Applies to all long-term care Medicaid applications and renewals involving charitable giving transactions during the lookback period

## Key Definitions

**Bona Fide Charitable Giving** – Legitimate donations made with charitable intent, consistent with historical patterns, and not for the purpose of establishing Medicaid eligibility

**Charitable Gift** – A donation of cash or property to an organization (typically non-profit) or to family members/friends to mark special occasions, where the gift giver does not expect anything tangible in return

**Deprivation of Resources** – The elimination or reduction of recorded ownership or control of a resource for less than fair market value during the lookback period

**Fair Market Value (FMV)** – The price an item of a particular make, model, size, material, or condition will sell for on the open market in the geographic area involved

**Financial Exploitation** – The illegal or improper use of a vulnerable adult's funds, property, or resources by another person for monetary or personal benefit

**Lookback Period** – The period of time (60 months for institutional care) during which resource transfers are reviewed for potential deprivation penalties

**Long-Term Care Services and Supports** – Services including nursing facility care, home and community-based services, and waiver services requiring medical assistance

**Non-Profit Organization** – An organization that operates for the good of a community without intent of making a profit; may be religious, cultural, political, or social in nature

**Pattern of Giving** – Historical record of charitable donations showing consistency in frequency, amount, and recipient over time

**Power of Attorney (POA)** – Legal document granting authority to another person to act on behalf of the principal in financial or healthcare matters

**Transfer of Resources** – Any transaction involving disposal of a resource for less than fair market value, potentially subject to Medicaid penalty period

## Purpose & Legal Context

**Purpose of Guidance:**
To provide staff with a framework for distinguishing bona fide charitable giving from improper asset transfers, ensuring fair treatment of applicants while protecting program integrity.

**Policy Evolution:**
Previously, no allowance for charitable giving was permitted, resulting in automatic deprivation penalties. Current policy recognizes that genuine charitable giving should not be penalized when it reflects sincerely held beliefs and consistent historical behavior rather than intentional asset reduction for Medicaid eligibility.

**Regulatory Status:**
This guide represents interim policy while new regulations are being drafted to formalize the deprivation review process. Staff must review transactions carefully due to the prohibition on transferring assets for less than fair market value.

## Section 1: Defining Charitable Gifts

### 1.1 What is a Charitable Gift?

A charitable gift is a donation of cash or property to an organization, typically a non-profit organization. The organization may be religious, cultural, political, or social, but generally operates for the good of a community and not with the intent of making a profit.

**For Medicaid Review Purposes, Charitable Gifts Include:**

1. **Organizational Donations:**
   - Religious organizations (churches, temples, mosques, synagogues)
   - Cultural organizations (museums, arts centers, heritage societies)
   - Political organizations (campaigns, advocacy groups, political parties)
   - Social organizations (charities, community groups, service organizations)

2. **Personal Gifts:**
   - Gifts to family members to mark holidays (Christmas, birthdays, anniversaries)
   - Gifts to friends for special occasions (weddings, graduations, births)
   - Traditional seasonal giving (holiday gifts, graduation gifts)

### 1.2 Characteristics of Charitable Gifts

**Key Distinguishing Feature:**
The gift giver usually does not expect anything tangible in return for the gift. If something of value is received in exchange, this may indicate a commercial transaction rather than charitable giving.

**Medicaid Review Requirement:**
Transactions must be reviewed carefully due to the prohibition on transferring assets for less than fair market value. Staff must determine whether the transaction represents genuine charitable intent or an attempt to reduce assets for Medicaid eligibility.

## Section 2: Evaluation Factors for Charitable Giving

### 2.1 Intent-Based Review Approach

When reviewing transactions for charitable giving, it is best to look at the **totality of the circumstances**. It may be necessary to gather additional information to gain a better view of the nature of the giving.

**Primary Objective:**
Determine the person's intent behind the gifting. This may require looking at a pattern of giving rather than just a single transaction.

**Decision Standard:**
A deprivation penalty may NOT be imposed if, after review of the factors below, it appears that a person has given consistent amounts for a charitable purpose over a long period of time and did not intend to reduce their assets for Medicaid eligibility.

### 2.2 Factor 1: Consistency of Recipients

**Question:** Has the person given to the same, or similar, organizations over a period of time?

**Evaluation:**
- Consistent giving to same recipients indicates charitable intent driven by sincerely held beliefs
- Pattern of giving to different recipients each time may indicate asset reduction strategy
- Giving to similar organizations (e.g., various religious charities) can still demonstrate pattern

**Interpretation:**
Regular giving to the same recipients is an indication that gifting was driven by sincerely held beliefs and was not done to transfer assets.

### 2.3 Factor 2: Frequency and Pattern

**Question:** Is the pattern of giving approximately the same over the period of time?

**Consider:**
- **Frequency:** Weekly? Monthly? Annually? At specific times of the year?
- **Timing:** Gifts on specific religious holidays, birthdays, anniversaries?
- **Regularity:** Predictable schedule or sporadic giving?

**Evaluation:**
- Consistent frequency indicates established charitable practice
- Sudden changes in frequency near Medicaid application may indicate intent to reduce assets
- Regular annual giving (e.g., annual church pledge) demonstrates pattern

### 2.4 Factor 3: Amount Consistency

**Question:** Is the amount given consistent over the period of giving?

**Evaluation:**

**Consistent Amounts:**
- Indicate gifting was done for the same purpose over time
- Support conclusion of genuine charitable intent
- Examples: $100/month to church, $50/year to public radio, $25 birthday gifts

**Significantly Increased Amounts:**
- If gifting has increased significantly just prior to requesting Medicaid, this may indicate the person is trying to reduce assets to establish eligibility
- Should be considered a potential deprivation
- Example: Donor who gave $500/year to charity for 10 years suddenly gives $10,000 in year before nursing home admission

### 2.5 Factor 4: Proportion to Overall Assets

**Question:** Do the amounts given represent a large portion of the person's overall assets?

**Evaluation:**

**Small Proportion:**
- Giving that represents reasonable percentage of income or assets supports charitable intent
- Example: Person with $200,000 in assets giving $1,000/year to charity

**Large Proportion:**
- Even if giving has been consistent over a recent period, if the aggregate amount is large or represents a large portion of the person's overall assets, this is an indication that the person may have been trying to reduce assets in order to become eligible
- Example: Person with $50,000 in assets gives away $40,000 over 6 months before application
- Requires careful scrutiny even if giving was to legitimate charities

**Critical Consideration:**
The relationship between gift amounts and the person's financial capacity is essential to determining intent.

### 2.6 Factor 5: Exchange of Value

**Question:** Was anything of value received in exchange for the gift?

#### 2.6a Commercial Transactions Disguised as Gifts

In some cases, a person may receive something of value in exchange for a "gift." This may be an indication that there is really a commercial transaction, and not giving, that is occurring.

**Example of Commercial Transaction:**
- Some organizations may provide a burial space in a specific location in exchange for a gift of a certain amount
- This is more like a commercial transaction of purchasing a burial space than someone gifting money to the organization
- Should be treated as a purchase, not charitable giving

#### 2.6b Nominal Gifts vs. Valuable Consideration

Not all items received in exchange for a gift represent a commercial transaction. Some organizations give gifts of nominal value to donors as show of appreciation.

**Example of Nominal Gift:**
- Donors to an organization may receive a tote bag when they make a donation
- The tote bag is rarely a determining factor in making the gift
- Such nominal items do not convert charitable donation into commercial transaction

**Evaluation Guideline:**
If the value received approaches or exceeds the donation amount, treat as commercial transaction. If value is nominal (typically under $25-50), treat as charitable giving.

## Section 3: Documentation Requirements

### 3.1 Documentation Standards

It is important to document your review of charitable giving for audit purposes. All determinations must be thoroughly documented in the case narrative.

### 3.2 When Giving is Determined to be Bona Fide

**If you find that the giving was bona fide, document:**

1. **What was given:**
   - Dollar amounts or property descriptions
   - Dates of gifts
   - Recipients of gifts

2. **Results of your review:**
   - Which evaluation factors were considered
   - Evidence supporting charitable intent
   - Pattern of giving over time

3. **Your determination:**
   - Clear statement that the giving was not a transfer of resources
   - Basis for conclusion that no deprivation penalty applies
   - Reference to specific factors supporting decision

**Example Documentation:**
> *"Applicant has given $100/month to First Baptist Church for past 15 years per bank statements. Giving is consistent with religious practice, represents small portion of monthly income, and continued through period of financial stability. Gifts made with charitable intent and not for purpose of establishing Medicaid eligibility. No deprivation penalty applies."*

### 3.3 When Giving is Determined to be Transfer of Resources

**If you determine that the giving is a transfer of resources, document:**

1. **Transactions used as basis for deprivation penalty:**
   - Specific dates and amounts
   - Recipients
   - Why these transactions do not meet charitable giving criteria

2. **Evaluation results:**
   - Which factors indicated asset transfer rather than charitable giving
   - Evidence of intent to reduce assets
   - Deviation from historical patterns

3. **Penalty calculation:**
   - Total amount of transfer
   - Penalty period calculation
   - Start date of penalty period

### 3.4 Mixed Scenarios

**In some cases, you may find some charitable giving and some outright transfers:**

In those cases, you will need to document which transactions fit into each category in order to impose the deprivation penalty appropriately.

**Example:**
- Regular monthly church donations of $100 = bona fide charitable giving (not penalized)
- One-time gift of $20,000 to adult child just before application = transfer of resources (penalized)

**Documentation must clearly distinguish:**
- Which transactions are excluded as bona fide charitable giving
- Which transactions are included in deprivation penalty calculation
- Rationale for each categorization

## Section 4: Special Considerations and Red Flags

### 4.1 Financial Exploitation Warning Signs

**Critical Consideration:**
People requesting assistance with long-term care are a vulnerable population. You should always be aware of situations in which another person is attempting to take advantage of a client so that this can be reported for investigation.

### 4.2 Red Flag: Transactions Involving Guardians or POAs

**Look for transactions going to anyone who has been appointed a guardian or who has Power of Attorney:**

**Why This Matters:**
- These roles generally have a duty to not use the protected person's assets to their own advantage
- A POA agreement must **specifically allow** the POA to give to charities or to give or transfer assets to the POA
- Guardianship orders will generally **prohibit** the guardian from using the ward's assets for personal benefit

**Evaluation Steps:**
1. Review POA document to determine scope of authority
2. Review guardianship order for specific restrictions
3. Determine if charitable giving or transfers fall within authorized scope
4. If gifts exceed authority, consider as potential exploitation

### 4.3 Red Flag: Unusual Gifts to Friends or Relatives

**Look for transactions to friends or relatives which:**
- Do not fit an established pattern
- Are unusually large compared to historical giving
- Occur suddenly before Medicaid application

**Context:**
- Relatives can sometimes feel entitled to someone's assets
- May think they were promised certain items
- Charitable promises to family members are generally unenforceable

**Evaluation:**
Compare recent gifts to historical pattern. Significant deviations warrant investigation.

### 4.4 Red Flag: Potential Scams

**Awareness:**
Elderly members of the community are targets for scammers, and these transactions are not considered charitable giving.

**If you suspect someone is being taken advantage of by a scam:**

1. **First:** Report to someone with financial authority to stop the transactions (such as a POA)
2. **If no one with authority exists OR if you suspect someone with authority is aiding in the scam:**
   - Make a report to Adult Protective Services (APS)
   - Document the suspected exploitation in case narrative
   - Follow DHHS protocols for reporting suspected abuse

**Common Scam Indicators:**
- Requests for wire transfers or gift cards
- Urgency or pressure to give immediately
- Claims of emergency or crisis
- Requests to keep giving secret from family
- Gifts to unknown organizations or individuals

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Policy Shift:** Department now allows bona fide charitable giving; no automatic deprivation penalties for genuine charitable donations with consistent patterns

✓ **Totality of Circumstances:** Review must consider the complete picture—pattern over time, amounts, frequency, recipients—not just individual transactions

✓ **Intent is Key:** Primary question is whether giving reflects sincerely held beliefs and historical practice versus intent to reduce assets for Medicaid eligibility

✓ **Consistency Factors:** Evaluate consistency of recipients, frequency, amounts, and timing; deviations from established patterns may indicate asset transfer

✓ **Proportion Matters:** Even consistent giving may be penalized if aggregate amounts represent large portion of overall assets, indicating intent to divest

✓ **Exchange of Value Test:** Transactions where something of substantial value is received in return are commercial transactions, not charitable gifts

✓ **Thorough Documentation Required:** All determinations must be clearly documented with specific evaluation factors, evidence, and rationale for audit purposes

✓ **Mixed Transactions:** Cases may include both bona fide charitable giving (not penalized) and asset transfers (penalized); each transaction must be categorized individually

✓ **Vulnerable Population Protection:** Always be alert for financial exploitation, particularly involving guardians, POAs, or unusual gifts to relatives and friends

✓ **Reporting Obligation:** Suspected scams or exploitation must be reported to appropriate authorities (POA, APS) to protect vulnerable adults
