## Important Reminders

**477 Medicaid Manual:** The Medicaid 477 NAC manual has been moved to the Secretary of State's website: [477 MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY](https://sos.nebraska.gov). Staff will need to go to the SOS website, click on the applicable chapter and search for the manual reference noted (Tip: Use Ctrl + F to bring up a search function).

**HHA/MAGI Expansion:** Effective with the December 2021 NFOCUS release, budgets are displayed as HHA Basic or HHA Prime however, all HHA/MAGI Expansion participants received full Medicaid benefits effective 10/1/2021. Effective with the April 2022 NFOCUS release, when running an HHA/MAGI Expansion budget it will appear in NFOCUS as "MAGI Expansion" or "MAGI EXPANS," depending on the screen being viewed. For HHA/MAGI Expansion budgets prior to 10/01/2021, it will continue to appear in NFOCUS as HHA Basic or HHA Prime unless a recent budget has been processed.

**Federal Tax Information (FTI) Confidentiality:** Any federal tax information received from the IRS data hub is strictly confidential. This information is not to be shared with applicant, individual and other parties. This information is not to be copied, stored, and/or printed.

**Tax/Hub Access:** A signed application allows you to ping the federal Tax/Hub initially.

**Verification Request Timing:** When a Verification Request is due, allow for the VR Due alert to generate before taking negative action.
