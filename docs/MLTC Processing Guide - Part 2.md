## MAGI Eligibility Processing – New Application

### Step 1: Begin {#magi-begin}

• Accept work task "Application Received" if applicable.

---

### Step 2: Check for Valid Application {#magi-check-valid-application}

• Check for a valid application: containing name, address and signature. (see 477 NAC 3-005). For MAGI, we would accept the MILTC-53, HCNE, HCPH, and HCMP applications.

**If application is valid:**
- Go to Step 3 in this section

**If application is not valid:**
- Take appropriate steps to obtain a valid application:
  - See the [Standalone Application Chart](Standalone%20Application%20Chart.md) for information on proper applications
  - See [Valid Application Signature](Valid%20Application%20Signature.md) for information on valid application signatures
  - Utilize the [MLTC Consent Line Process Guide](MLTC%20Consent%20Line%20Process%20Guide.md) for applications missing a signature

• Attempt to contact the individual by phone for follow-up if areas on the application are left blank or where clarification is needed. See [Unanswered Questions](Unanswered%20Questions.md) for further information.

**Former Foster Care:**
- Refer to [Former Foster Care Guide](Former%20Foster%20Care%20Guide.md) for further information when the application indicates that an individual was previously in Foster Care, in any state, and is under age 26.

**Incarcerated Individuals:**
- Applications must be accepted and Medicaid eligibility determined for individuals who are residing in a 24 hour facility that are being discharged either the month the application was submitted or the month after the application was submitted
- Examples of these facilities include Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Centers, Regional Centers, Department of Corrections facilities, County Jails, and County Youth facilities

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The SUPPORT Act of October 2018 added a provision that applies to applications received for juveniles (defined as individuals under age 21 and individuals who may be eligible under Former Foster Care). The state is required to accept and process applications for individuals up to age 26 at any point during their period of incarceration.

**Universal Staff Duties:**
- For any application received where an individual indicates they are incarcerated, staff must assign the case to the **INC ASSIST position number (66118075)**
- See [Medicaid Position Numbers for Case Assignments](Medicaid%20Position%20Numbers%20for%20Case%20Assignments.md) for further information

**Assigned Staff Duties:**
- Verification of the release date from the facility is required prior to processing the application
- Verifications can be provided from staff at the facility
- The assigned worker will also need to know where the individual will be residing upon discharge, household composition, tax household information, and verification of income of any individual who would be financially responsible for the client based on the tax filing status

### Step 3: Compare Application to System {#magi-compare-application}

• Review NFOCUS entries with information provided on current application (see also the MAGI Initial Processing Checklist). If information does not match, make corrections to the information in NFOCUS:

**Review the following:**
- Screen for Duplicate Application (see below)
- Screen to determine if the application is considered a renewal form (e.g., case was previously closed less than 90 days ago during the review process for not providing a renewal form). See [Changes Reported During 90 Day Redetermination Period](Changes%20Reported%20During%2090%20Day%20Redetermination%20Period.md) for further information
- Voter registration requested (see the [Voter Registration SOP](Voter%20Registration%20SOP%207.2021.md))
- Comments section
- Address (physical and mailing), telephone and email information
- Notification preferences: mail, email, text (SMS)
- Correct applicants pended?
- Tax Household and Tax Permission
- Screen to ensure application is a MAGI application and review for age
- Add Authorized Representative, if listed
- Review for Retroactive Medicaid request. Follow steps in the [Retroactive Medicaid Process](Retroactive%20Medicaid%20Process.md)
- Review Sanctions
- Review Work Tasks and Alerts

**Duplicate Applications:**

A duplicate application is an application that is:
1. Received on an active case participant with no review due; or,
2. Received within 90 days of the closure or denial date

**Processing duplicate applications:**
- Duplicate applications received must be reviewed for changes and action taken on these reported changes
- See [Duplicate Applications](Duplicate%20Applications.md) and "Is a New Medicaid Application Needed?" for further information

**Once an application has been identified as a duplicate, the following steps must be taken:**

1. If the case was pended, deny the pending case for 'Other' and send a notice
2. If the case was not pended, a Generic Notice must be created
3. Include comments on the Notice:
   - Manual reference 477 NAC 3-005.06
   - Explanation that the application is being denied as it was identified as duplicate
   - Inform the applicant of verification(s) needed to complete determination and the deadline for the 90 days, calculated from the date of the original application
   - **TOOL:** Calculator for Days 30, 45, 60, and 90

4. Check Program Case Mode: it may be necessary to update it to Change Management
5. Change the application tie reason from initial to duplicate:
   - From the detail master case window, select the program applications
   - Highlight the duplicate application window and select update
   - Change the application reason from initial to duplicate

**Active Individuals:**

If an individual is active in a Medicaid program case and would be transitioning to a different Medicaid category, a new application is not required. Application forms can be used as a tool for staff to obtain information from an active individual however, it cannot be a required form that the agency obtains, unless it is at the applicable renewal time.

**Example #1:** Individual is in MAGI Expansion and begins receiving Medicare. The individual needs to be reviewed for eligibility in a Non-MAGI category. A new application may be helpful to obtain attestation of resource information but cannot be required of the participant.

**Example #2:** Individual is over income for a MAGI category and does not meet eligibility for a Non-MAGI category. The worker is reviewing for MN/PC eligibility. A new/supplemental application may be helpful to obtain attestation of resource information but cannot be required of the participant.

### Step 4: Social Security Number (SSN) {#magi-ssn}

• Check applicant's blue SSA interface to ensure they have HUB SSN Verified.

**If not verified:**
- First check demographic information (name, DOB and SSN) has been entered correctly in NFOCUS
- If further clarification is needed after comparing with the application, call the individual
- If call to individual does not resolve the issue, send a VR for the social security number
- **Do not request copies of Social Security cards from individuals**

**Medicaid recipients must have a valid Social Security Number except for the following:**
- Infants less than a year old who were born to a Medicaid eligible mother
- 599 CHIP & EMSA participants
- Applicants with a "Well Established Religious Objection"
- An individual that is not requesting Medicaid is not required to provide their Social Security number

**For individuals who DO NOT CURRENTLY have a Social Security Number:**
- If the SSN is the only item needed to process - process the application
- If approved, create a VR informing the individual they have 90 days from date of application to provide a SSN or verification that they have applied for a Social Security Number with the SSA
- The VR due date must be set for 90 days from the date the VR is being sent

### Step 5: Citizenship & Immigration {#magi-citizenship-immigration}

• Check that all applicants either have verified U.S. citizenship or verified eligible immigration status. If citizenship or immigration status has not been verified, submit all applicants for verification:

**Verification sources:**
- The Citizenship and Immigration screen (Actions menu > US Citizenship and Immigration) and the blue SSA interface can be reviewed for citizenship verification
- The VLP interface can be reviewed for eligible immigration status

**Reasonable Opportunity (RO) Period:**

If the applicant attests to being a US citizen or having a Medicaid eligible immigration status that cannot be verified because (1) there are no available electronic data sources, (2) VLP is in Step 2 or 3, or (3) paper verifications are being requested; process the application as long as all other points of eligibility have been verified. The individual(s) must be notified of the reasonable opportunity period on the Notice of Action. See [Reasonable Opportunity Period](Reasonable%20Opportunity%20Period.md) and [Reasonable Opportunity Examples](Reasonable%20Opportunity%20Examples.md) for more information.

**RO Period procedures:**
- If additional information is needed from the applicant to verify citizenship or immigration status (e.g., copies of documents), send a VR for the information to be returned
- The VR due date must mirror the time allowed for the reasonable opportunity period
- Staff must set a manual 95 day alert for the individual's ongoing eligibility to be reviewed
  - RO policy allows for the 90 day clock to start on the date the individual receives the notice (generally 5 days after the date of notice)

**RO Notice Wording:**

On the Approval Notice, notify the applicant of the reasonable opportunity period using the language below. If an approval notice is not generated, send a Generic Notice with comments about the 90 day reasonable opportunity period. A notice is required to ensure the individual receives rights and responsibilities.

```
Citizenship or non-citizen status has not been verified for (NAME). A 90-day reasonable 
opportunity period (477 NAC 5-006) has been applied for the Department to conclude the 
electronic verification process and/or the applicant to provide the satisfactory citizenship 
or immigration documents. Retroactive Medicaid cannot be authorized during the reasonable 
opportunity period (42 CFR 435.956(a)(5)(iii)). If citizenship or non-citizen status has 
not been verified by (DATE; use the calculator on MERL), Medicaid benefits will be terminated.
```

**Refugees:**

If it is attested or verified that an individual is a refugee, staff must determine if the individual has been in the country for more than 12 months or less than 12 months. See the [Refugee Process](Refugee%20Process.md).

- **Individuals verified as refugees who have been in the country for 12 months or less** should be assigned to the **Refugee Medicaid Referral position number (87055714)**
- **Individuals verified as refugees who have been in the country for more than 12 months** must be processed by the worker and are not assigned to the position number
  - Review the Citizenship/Immigration task in the Expert system. If Refugee Resettlement Program (RRP) is listed, this is not a valid Medicaid immigration status and must be updated to the current immigration status or REF207 before processing any budgets

**EMSA:**

If no immigration status is indicated, consider eligibility for Emergency Medical Services Assistance (EMSA). See the [EMSA Process Guide](EMSA%20Process%20Guide.md) for further information.

**SAVE Documentation:**

For any situation where SAVE was utilized to verify immigration status, the SAVE documents need to be uploaded to Document Imaging (DI).

**Process Guides and Tools:**
- [MLTC Citizenship and Immigration Guide](MLTC%20Citizenship%20and%20Immigration%20Guide.md)
- [Qualified Non-Citizen Status Eligibility Guide](Qualified%20Non-Citizen%20Status%20Eligibility%20Guide.md)
- How to submit G845: [G-845 Immigration Documentation Process](G-845%20Immigration%20Documentation%20Process.md)

### Step 6: Family Relationships / Household Composition {#magi-family-relationships}

• Family relationships must be established prior to running any budget. Correct family relationships are key to NFOCUS identifying financial responsibility and the correct unit size.

• Attestation of family relationships are acceptable and must be narrated.

**When verification is needed:**
- If information provided is questionable/different from information known to the agency, verification of family relationships may be needed

**Family relationships can be verified:**
- **Electronically** - Vital Statistics (VS), CSE interface, VLP interface (COA codes), or;
- **Through paper documentation** in Document Imaging (e.g., birth & marriage certificates, hospital birth records, birth registration worksheet, etc.)

**If family relationships are not previously established in NFOCUS:**
- Complete family relationships in the Expert system
- See the Tax HH and MAGI Budgets WINK-ed for more information
- For attested relationships, choose one of the following drop-down verification sources: 'other-document in narrative,' or 'signed statement by person with knowledge'
- For verified relationships, choose the appropriate verification source from the drop-down

**Pregnancy:**

Review application for pregnancy. See the [Continuous Eligibility Guide](Continuous%20Eligibility%20Guide.md) for further information.

- If there is already an unborn on the case, check the Expected Date of Delivery in NFOCUS against the information on the application
- If this is for a pregnancy that ended (e.g., Overdue), terminate the previous pregnancy
