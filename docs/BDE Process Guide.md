# BDE Process Guide
*Beneficiary Data Exchange Interface and Alert Processing Procedures*

---

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive guidance for staff when navigating the various alerts received via the Beneficiary Data Exchange (BDE) interface. The BDE interface is a critical data exchange system from the Social Security Administration (SSA) that reports Social Security information to the State of Nebraska for individuals who have applied for or are receiving public assistance benefits. This guide consolidates all BDE-related information into a single, streamlined document to improve efficiency and accuracy in processing BDE alerts and interfaces.

The guide is organized into five sections covering different aspects of BDE processing: initial alert response procedures, SVES requests and beneficiary identification codes, address and payment status processes, specific BDE interfaces and alerts, and miscellaneous considerations including early retirement determinations and garnishments.

**Effective Date:** April 2025  
**Document Type:** Process Guide  
**Scope:** All MLTC eligibility staff processing BDE alerts and interfaces

## Key Definitions

**Beneficiary Data Exchange (BENDEX/BDE)** – A file exchange from the Social Security Administration (SSA) that reports Social Security information to the State of Nebraska for individuals who have either applied for or are receiving public assistance benefits. This interface provides critical income and benefit information for Medicaid eligibility determinations.

**Beneficiary Identification Code (BIC)** – A code used by SSA to identify the relationship between a beneficiary and the primary wage earner on whose record benefits are being paid. These codes help determine which claim number should be used for SVES requests.

**Current Pay (CP)** – Status indicating an individual is currently receiving a physical check or electronic payment from the Social Security Administration.

**Non-Pay (NP)** – Status indicating an individual is not receiving a physical check or electronic payment from the Social Security Administration, often due to suspension, address issues, or other payment holds.

**Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (RSDI)** – Retirement, survivors, and disability benefits paid to workers, their dependents, and survivors. RSDI is commonly referred to as Social Security and this benefit is reported in the BDE Interface.

**Social Security Administration (SSA)** – A U.S. government agency that administers social programs covering disability, Medicare, retirement, and survivors' benefits.

**Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)** – A payroll tax-funded federal insurance program managed by the SSA and designed to provide income supplements to people who are physically restricted in their ability to be employed because of a notable disability. SSDI can be supplied on either a temporary or permanent basis and is reported in the BDE Interface.

**State Verification and Exchange System (SVES)** – A system that allows states to request and receive detailed benefit information from SSA for individuals receiving or applying for benefits. SVES requests can be made by claim number or Social Security number.

**SVES Claim Request** – A request submitted through NFOCUS to obtain benefit information for a participant receiving benefits on another person's claim number. Requires the complete claim number including the letter/number code suffix.

**SVES SSN Request** – A request submitted through NFOCUS to obtain benefit information for a participant receiving benefits on their own claim number. This request is sent automatically when a case person is registered in NFOCUS.

## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of the BDE Process Guide is to provide guidance for staff when navigating the various alerts received via the BDE interface and to combine all information into a single, streamlined document. 

### Document Organization

The guide is separated into five distinct sections:

- **Section 1** provides direction regarding what to do when a BDE alert is received
- **Section 2** provides direction regarding SVES claim requests, SVES SSN requests, and Beneficiary Identification Codes (BIC)
- **Section 3** provides direction regarding address mismatch, suspension, and non-pay of BDE benefits processes
- **Section 4** provides direction regarding BDE interfaces and alerts
- **Section 5** provides direction regarding miscellaneous considerations including early retirement vs. disability determinations and garnishments

### Important Reminder

**Staff should review all pertinent information on the BDE Interfaces screens prior to contacting SSA with questions.** Interfaces may include partial information or not answer all questions that need to be clarified when processing an application, change, or renewal. It may be necessary for the worker to call out to another agency or the client to clarify information further.

---

## Section 1: Initial BDE Alert Response

### When a BDE Alert is Received

When a BDE alert is received, the following action should be taken:

#### Step 1: Identify the Person in the Alert

A Master Case may have several members who have applied, been recently approved, or are currently receiving RSDI benefits. **Make sure you are viewing the information for the person identified in the alert.**

#### Step 2: Check the Payment Status for RSDI Benefits

**If the person remains Current Pay (CP):**

1. Check the address in the Demographics screen to ensure that the address on file with SSA matches the address known to the agency
2. If the address does not match, refer to [Section 3: Address Mismatch](#address-mismatch-client-remains-cp-different-nebraska-address)

**If the person is in Non-Pay (NP) status:**

1. Refer to [Section 3: Address Mismatch, Suspension, and Non-Pay of BDE Benefits Processes](#section-3-address-mismatch-suspension-and-non-pay-processes)

#### Step 3: Check the BDE Benefit Detail Screen for Income

The BDE Benefit Detail screen will alert a worker to RSDI benefits generally. Sometimes it will include information from other sources of income, like RSDI benefits received on a spouse or a parent's claim, or railroad income.

**Key Information on the Benefit Detail Screen:**

- **Entitlement Information:** The Benefit Detail Screen under Entitlement will show:
  - Current entitlement date
  - Initial entitlement date
  - Disability date (if applicable)

> **Important:** Workers must remember that because a client has RSDI does not necessarily mean that they are disabled. See the Interfaces WINK-ed for additional information.

**Benefits Received Off Another Individual's Claim:**

In most cases, benefits received off another individual's claim will appear in the BDE interface. If the information is not in BDE, then a **SVES Claim Request** must be sent with the correct claim number in order to bring the new information into NFOCUS.

---

## Section 2: SVES Requests and Beneficiary Identification Codes

### SVES Claim Request

The SVES Claim Request is often required if the participant is receiving a benefit off another person's claim and not their own. Additional action may be required up-front to obtain the actual claim number (i.e., review application, callout to the applicant/representative, call to SSA). **The accurate claim information is required to get a response in BDE.**

See the SVES WINK and the WINK - SVES Claim Requests for additional information.

#### How to Send an SVES Claim Request

1. **Navigate to NFOCUS Interfaces Menu** from the Person Detail screen
2. **Enter the SSA claim number** including the letter/number code at the end (e.g., 123456789C2) and press the Tab key
3. **The SVES Claim Request Button should now populate**
4. **Press the button to send the request** – A response can take a few business days to receive
5. **Set an alert** to determine if SVES information has been received after the request has been submitted
6. **If information has been received**, the accurate claim information should be available in the BDE Interface
7. **If information has not been received**, the process may have to be repeated

### SVES SSN Request

The SVES SSN Request typically only returns claim information if the participant is receiving income off their own claim number (or is dual/triple entitled and receiving income from their own claim number in addition to another claim). 

**This request type will NOT return results if the participant is only receiving benefits off other people's claims.**

The SVES SSN Request is sent automatically when a case person is registered in NFOCUS; however, a worker may initiate the request at any time.

#### How to Send an SVES SSN Request

1. **Navigate to NFOCUS Interfaces Menu** from the Person Detail screen
2. **Press the SVES SSN Request button** to send your request – A response can take a few business days to receive
3. **Set an alert** to determine if SVES information has been received after the request has been submitted
4. **If information has been received**, the accurate claim information should be available in the BDE Interface
5. **If information has not been received**, the process may have to be repeated

### Beneficiary Identification Codes (BIC)

Follow the **Social Security Beneficiary Identification Codes (BIC) document** in MERL for more descriptions of specific codes and their meanings.

> **Reminder:** Remember to obtain the correct claim number the participant is receiving the benefit from. If not displayed in the SDX Financial Tab, this may require contacting the SSA, the participant, or their representative.

## Section 3: Address Mismatch, Suspension, and Non-Pay Processes

### Address Mismatch (Client Remains CP; Different Nebraska Address)

If the client remains Current Pay in BDE but there's a different **Nebraska address** listed in BDE:

1. **Review the client's NFOCUS address history**
2. **Determine if the BDE address is the client's old address:**

**If YES** (BDE address was previously listed in NFOCUS):
- Send the client a speed note to inform them their old address is still on file with SSA
- Advise them they should update their address with SSA to avoid any future interruption in benefits

**If NO** (BDE address was not previously in NFOCUS):
- Update the client's address to the new address verified in BDE

#### Out of State Mailing Address

If the client remains Current Pay with a Nebraska physical address, but there is an **out of state mailing address** listed in BDE:

1. **Make a call out to the client** prior to updating the mailing address to the out of state address
2. Verify the accuracy of the out of state mailing address with the client
3. Update NFOCUS accordingly based on client verification

### BDE Interface: Suspended – Address Unknown

In this situation, SSA uses this code when they need to speak with the client. This could be for address unknown or for a non-medical update for changes in income or incarceration.

#### Procedure

**Attempt a call to the client:**

**If successful:**
1. Update the client's address in NFOCUS

**If unsuccessful:**

**AND DHHS is aware of the client's address:**
1. Leave the address that is listed in NFOCUS
2. Send a speednote to the client informing them of their need to contact SSA to update their address

**AND the speednote or other mail is being returned:**
1. It is likely that DHHS and SSA do not know where the client is
2. The worker must follow the **Returned Mail Process** for additional action

### BDE Interface: Suspended - Returned Check

In this situation, SSA uses this code when they need to speak with the client. This could be due to:
- The client's routing number to the bank being incorrect
- A representative payee may have inadvertently returned the check
- The client may have returned the check

#### Procedure

**Attempt a call to the client:**

**If successful:**
1. Inform the client of their need to contact SSA and update their information

**If unsuccessful:**
1. Send a speednote to the client informing them of their need to contact SSA to update their information
2. If the speednote or other mail is being returned, it is likely that DHHS and SSA do not know where the client is
3. The worker must follow the **Returned Mail Process** for additional action

### BDE Interface: Non-Pay – Refused Vocational Rehab

#### Procedure

**Attempt a call to the client:**

**If successful:**
1. Inform the client of their need to contact SSA and update their information

**If unsuccessful:**
1. Send a speednote to the client informing them of their need to contact SSA to update their information
2. If the speednote or other mail is being returned, it is likely that DHHS and SSA do not know where the client is
3. The worker must follow the **Returned Mail Process** for additional action

## Section 4: BDE Interfaces and Alerts

### Alert #68: Buy-In Rejected

CMS has rejected an attempt by the State to establish Buy-In for this client because their database indicates there is an error with this client in matching their Medicare Claim Number.

#### Actions Required

1. **Verify the status of the client**
2. **Verify the Medicare Claim Number** (Benefit Claim Number), in case an erroneous number was submitted that matches for another client
3. **If the information is erroneous**, refer the client to the local Social Security Office
4. **If the Claim Number in NFOCUS is incorrect:**
   - Correct this and the system will automatically resubmit for Buy-In during the next scheduled input
5. **Check CMS/MBI interfaces** which may also verify this claim number

> **Note:** The Medicaid Claim Number may be different than a number designated for the client because the individual may be drawing benefits off of another individual's claim (example: may be eligible for benefits off of their spouse's claim number instead of their own due to age, etc.)

### Alert #414: Buy-In

CMS has deleted the State's Buy-In for this client because their Medicare entitlement has ended. This may be because they do not currently meet all requirements for Medicare (i.e., age, citizenship, continuation of disability). Follow-up may be necessary to determine what the change in status is and how it may affect the client's Medicaid eligibility.

#### Actions Required

1. **Check BDE interfaces and/or CMS interfaces** for possible updated information on continued eligibility

**BDE Interface Information:**
- BDE will show the **Entitlement Status** of the client for both Part A and Part B
- The worker can find this information in the Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B sections of the interface
- Access this tab by selecting the client's most-recent Payment Received date from the BDE interface tab

**CMS Interface Information:**
- CMS will show the **Enrollment Status** of the client for both Part A and Part B
- Click the Part A/B Enrollment tab in the CMS interface to view this information

**MBI Interface Information:**
- MBI will show information about what months are being rejected and potentially list a rejection code/reason as well

2. **Review Understanding the Parts of Medicare and the TPL Guide** document for more information regarding Medicare entitlement

### Alert #434: Interface Record

The Interface Record is run monthly and includes SDX, BDE, IUC, and Long-Term Care (LTC) rate changes.

#### When This Alert is Received for BDE

**The worker must:**

1. **Compare the payment amount** shown in BDE to what is shown in Unearned Income in the Expert system in NFOCUS
2. **Confirm the payment amount** is appearing in the NFOCUS budgets correctly (not double counting or missing, etc.)

**If the payment amounts match:**
- No action needs to be taken

**If the payment amounts do NOT match:**
1. Update the amount in Unearned Income in Expert to the current BDE amount
2. Process budgets accordingly

#### Important Review Requirements

The worker must review the BDE Interface screens and may need to review **multiple lines on the BDE (benefit screen)** to ensure we are accounting for the individual possibly receiving benefits from multiple claim numbers or off of a different claim number than their own.

> **Note:** The Medicaid Claim Number may be different than a number designated for the client because the individual may be drawing benefits off of another individual's claim (example: may be eligible for benefits off of their spouse's claim number instead of their own due to age, etc.)

### Alert #456: Benefits Suspended

SSA benefits were suspended on the client listed on the alert.

#### Actions Required

1. **Review policy regulations** to determine if the client remains eligible for assistance in any other Medicaid category
2. See the **MLTC Change Management Guide** for additional information

### Alert #457: SSA Adjustment

The SSA benefits have been reduced due to an overpayment or garnishment. See BDE for further information and enter the Adjust Reason in the Unearned Income task before processing budgets.

#### Procedure

1. **Contact SSA** to determine the timeframe the overpayments were received
2. **Determine whether the overpayments were received** by the client while they were receiving Medicaid

**If the client received both Medicaid and the benefit during the overpayment period:**
- The amount **after deduction** of the overpayment is used if the overpaid amount was included in the Medicaid budget

3. **Go to Unearned Income Tab in Expert** and add the Adjustment Reason
   - The Adjustment Reason will determine whether the gross or net SSA benefits should be used in the appropriate budgets
4. **Run the budgets and send a NOA**

---

## Section 5: Miscellaneous Considerations

### Early Retirement vs. Disability

The BDE interface may report a Disability Date for some clients between the ages of 62-64. This disability date may appear that the client is receiving SSA income based on a disability when they actually are receiving an early retirement payment.

#### Procedure for Clients Age 62-64 with New SSA Income

1. **Review the Interfaces WINK-ed** to determine if the client is determined disabled
2. **If income is from Early Retirement:**
   - This would NOT make the client categorically eligible for Non-MAGI
   - Client could remain in MAGI eligibility
3. **If the individual is only receiving Medicare**, it does not mean they have been determined to be disabled by SSA

> **Reference:** See Policy Memo 23-02 and the SRT Guide for additional information

### Garnishments

#### Non-MAGI Policy

Income which is being intercepted, withheld, or garnished, even if done pursuant to a court order, **is counted** in determining eligibility.

**Regulatory Citation:** 477 NAC 22-002.05

#### Garnishments and Overpayments

The amount **after deduction** of the overpayment is used if the client received both Medicaid and the other benefit at any time during which the overpayment occurred, and the overpaid amount was included in the Medicaid budget.

> **Reference:** See additional information above in this guide for Alert #457

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Review all BDE interface information before contacting SSA** – All pertinent information on BDE Interfaces screens should be reviewed prior to making external calls, as the interface may contain the answers needed.

✓ **Identify the correct person when multiple household members receive benefits** – A Master Case may have several members receiving RSDI benefits; always verify you are viewing information for the person identified in the alert.

✓ **RSDI benefits do not automatically mean disability status** – Just because a client has RSDI does not necessarily mean they are disabled; review entitlement information and disability dates carefully.

✓ **Use the correct SVES request type** – SVES Claim Requests are for benefits received on another person's claim; SVES SSN Requests are for benefits received on the participant's own claim.

✓ **Address mismatches require client contact for out-of-state addresses** – When a Nebraska physical address has an out-of-state mailing address in BDE, contact the client before updating the mailing address.

✓ **Follow Returned Mail Process for undeliverable mail** – If speednotes or other mail is being returned and neither DHHS nor SSA knows the client's location, follow the Returned Mail Process.

✓ **Alert #434 requires budget comparison** – When Interface Record alerts are received, compare BDE payment amounts to Unearned Income in Expert and update budgets if amounts do not match.

✓ **SSA Adjustments require determination of overpayment timeframe** – Contact SSA to determine when overpayments occurred and whether the client was receiving Medicaid during that period to determine correct budget treatment.

✓ **Early retirement ages 62-64 may show disability dates** – Clients between ages 62-64 may have disability dates in BDE but actually be receiving early retirement; verify actual benefit type.

✓ **Garnishments are counted as income for Non-MAGI** – Income that is intercepted, withheld, or garnished (even by court order) is counted in determining Non-MAGI eligibility, unless related to overpayments during Medicaid receipt.
