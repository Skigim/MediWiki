*[← Back to Index](README.md)*Beneficiary Data Exchange (BENDEX/BDE) – A file exchange from the Social Security Administration

(SSA) that reports Social Security information to the State of Nebraska for individuals who have either applied
for or are receiving public assistance benefits.
Current Pay (CP) – Currently receiving a physical check/electronic payment from the Social Security
Administration.
Non-Pay (NP) – Not receiving a physical check/electronic payment from the Social Security Administration.
Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (RSDI) - Retirement, survivors, and disability benefits paid
to workers, their dependents, and survivors. RSDI is commonly referred to as Social Security and this benefit is
reported in the BDE Interface.
Social Security Administration (SSA) - A U.S. government agency that administers social programs covering
disability, Medicare, retirement, and survivors' benefits.
Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) - A payroll tax-funded, federal insurance program of the United
States government. It is managed by the SSA and is designed to provide income supplements to people who are
physically restricted in their ability to be employed because of a notable disability; usually a physical disability.
SSDI can be supplied on either a temporary or permanent basis, usually directly correlated to whether the
person's disability is temporary, or permanent. This benefit is reported in the BDE Interface.
Purpose: The purpose of the BDE Process Guide is to provide guidance for staff when navigating the various
alerts received via the BDE interface, and to combine all information into a single, streamlined document. The
guide is separated into several different sections:
Section 1 provides direction regarding what to do when an BDE alert is received; Section 2 provides direction
regarding SVES claim requests, SVES SSN requests, and Beneficiary Identification Codes (BIC); Section 3
provides direction regarding address mismatch, suspension, and non-pay of BDE benefits processes; Section 4
provides direction regarding BDE interfaces and alerts; Section 5 provides direction regarding miscellaneous.
Reminder: Staff should review all pertinent information on the BDE Interfaces screens prior to
contacting SSA with questions.
Interfaces may also include partial information or not answer all questions that need to be clarified when
processing an application, change, or a renewal. It may be necessary for the worker to call out to another agency
or the client, etc. to clarify information further.
SECTION 1: What to Do When a BDE Alert is Received
When a BDE alert is received, the following action should be taken:
Identify the person in the alert. A Master Case may have several members who have applied, been
recently approved, or are currently receiving RSDI benefits. Make sure you are viewing the
information for the person identified in the alert. Check the payment status for RSDI benefits:
a. If the person remains Current Pay (CP):
i. Check the address in the Demographics screen to ensure that the address on file with SSA
matches the address known to the agency. If the address does not match, refer to the
Address Mismatch section of the guide.
b. If the person is in Non-Pay (NP) status, refer to the SECTION 3: Address Mismatch, Suspension,
and Non-Pay of BDE Benefits Processes.
1. Check the BDE Benefit Detail screen for income (See BDE Benefit Detail screen below).
a. The BDE Benefit Detail screen will alert a worker to RSDI benefits generally, sometimes it will
include information from other sources of income, like RSDI benefits received on a spouse or a
parent’s claim or railroad income.
b. The Benefit Detail Screen under Entitlement will show the worker the current entitlement date,
the initial entitlement date, and the disability date, if applicable. Workers must remember that
because a client has RSDI, does not necessarily mean that they are disabled. See the
Interfaces WINK-ed for additional information.
c. In most cases, benefits received off another individual’s claim will appear in the BDE interface.
If the information is not in BDE, then a SVES Claim Request must be sent with the correct claim
number, in order to bring the new information into NFOCUS.
SECTION 2: SVES Claim Request/SVES SSN Request and Beneficiary Identification
Codes (BIC)
The SVES Claim Request is often required if the participant is receiving a benefit off another person’s claim,
and not their own. Additional action may be required up-front to obtain the actual claim number (i.e., review
application, callout to the applicant/representative, call to SSA). The accurate claim information is required to
get a response in BDE. See the SVES WINK and the WINK- SVES Claim Requests for additional information.
1. To send an SVES Claim Request:
a. Go to the NFOCUS Interfaces Menu from the Person Detail screen. (See screen below)
b. Enter the SSA claim number, including the letter/number code at the end (123456789C2, in this
example), and press the Tab key. The SVES Claim Request Button should now populate.
c. Then, press the button to send the request. A response can take a few business days to receive.
d. The worker must set an alert to determine if SVES information has been received after the
request has been submitted. If information has been received the accurate claim information
should be available in the BDE Interface. The process may have to repeat if updated
information has not been received.
The SVES SSN Request typically only returns claim information if the participant is receiving income off their
own claim number (or is dual/triple entitled and receiving income from their own claim number in addition to
another claim). This request type will not return results if the participant is only receiving off other people’s
claims. The SVES SSN Request is sent automatically when a case person is registered in NFOCUS, however a
worker may initiate the request at any time.
1. To send an SVES SSN Request:
a. Go to the NFOCUS Interfaces Menu from the Person Detail screen. (See screen below)
b. Then, press the SVES SSN Request button to send your request. A response can take a few
business days to receive.
c. The worker must set an alert to determine if SVES information has been received after the
request has been submitted. If information has been received the accurate claim information
should be available in the BDE Interface. The process may have to repeat if updated
information has not been received.
Follow the Social Security Beneficiary Identification Codes (BIC) document in MERL for more
descriptions.
Reminder: Remember to obtain the correct claim number the participant is receiving the benefit from. If
not displayed in the SDX Financial Tab, this may require contacting the SSA, the participant, or their
representative.
SECTION 3: Address Mismatch, Suspension, and Non-Pay of BDE Benefits Processes
Address Mismatch (Client Remains CP; Different Nebraska Address):
If the client remains BDE, but there’s a different NEBRASKA address listed in BDE:
1. Review the client’s NFOCUS address history.
2. Is the address in BDE the client’s old address that was previously listed in NFOCUS?
YES—Send the client a speed note to inform them their old address is still on file with SSA, and they
should update their address to avoid any future interruption in benefits.
NO—Update the client’s address to the new address verified in BDE.
If the client remains BDE with a Nebraska physical address, but there is an out of state mailing address listed in
BDE:
1. Make a call out to the client prior to updating the mailing address to the out of state address.
BDE Interface: Suspended – Address Unknown:
In this situation, SSA uses this code when they need to speak with the client. This could be for address
unknown, or for a non-medical update for changes in income, or incarceration.
Attempt a call to the client:
1. If successful:
a. Update the client’s address in NFOCUS.
2. If unsuccessful:
a. And DHHS is aware of the client’s address, leave the address that is listed in NFOCUS.
i Send a speednote to the client informing them of their need to contact SSA to update
their address.
b. If the speednote or other mail is being returned it is likely that DHHS and SSA do not know
where the client is. The worker must follow the Returned Mail Process for additional action.
BDE Interface: Suspended - Returned Check:
In this situation, SSA uses this code when they need to speak with the client. This could be due to the client’s
routing number to the bank being incorrect; a representative payee may have inadvertently returned the check; or
the client may have returned the check.
Attempt a call to the client:
1. If successful:
a. Inform the client of their need to contact SSA and update their information.
2. If unsuccessful:
a. Send a speednote to the client informing them of their need to contact SSA to update their
information.
b. If the speednote or other mail is being returned it is likely that DHHS and SSA do not know
where the client is. The worker must follow the Returned Mail Process for additional action.
BDE Interface: Non-Pay – Refused Vocational Rehab:
Attempt a call to the client:
1. If successful:
a. Inform the client of their need to contact SSA and update their information.
2. If unsuccessful:
a. Send a speednote to the client informing them of their need to contact SSA to update their
information.
b. If the speednote or other mail is being returned it is likely that DHHS and SSA do not know
where the client is. The worker must follow the Returned Mail Process for additional action.
SECTION 4: BDE Interfaces and Alerts
Alert #68: Buy-In Rejected:
CMS has rejected an attempt by the State to establish Buy-In for this client because their database indicates
there is an error with this client in matching their Medicare Claim Number.
1. Verify the status of the client.
2. Also verify the Medicare Claim Number (Benefit Claim Number), in case an erroneous number was
submitted that matches for another client.
3. If the information is erroneous refer the client to the local Social Security Office.
4. If the Claim Number in NFOCUS is incorrect, correct this and the system will automatically resubmit
for Buy-In during the next scheduled input.
5. Remember to check CMS/MBI interfaces which may also verify this claim number. The Medicaid
Claim Number may be different than a number designated for the client because the individual may be
drawing benefits off of another individual’s claim (example: may be eligible for benefits off of their
spouse’s claim number instead of their own due to age, etc.).
Alert #414: Buy-In:
CMS has deleted the State's Buy-In for this client because his/her Medicare entitlement has ended. This may be
because s/he does not currently meet all requirements for Medicare, i.e., age, citizenship, continuation of
disability. Follow-up may be necessary to determine what the change in status is and how it may affect the
client’s Medicaid eligibility.
1. Check BDE interfaces, and/or CMS interfaces for possible updated information on continued eligibility.
a. BDE will show the Entitlement Status of the client for both Part A, and Part B.
i. For BDE, the worker can find this information in the Medicare Part A, and Medicare Part
B sections of the interface. The worker can access this tab by selecting the clients most-
recent Payment Received date from the BDE interface tab.
b. CMS will show the Enrollment Status of the client for both Part A, and Part B. The worker will
click the Part A/B Enrollment tab in the CMS interface to view this information.
c. MBI will show information about what months are being rejected and potentially list a rejection
code/reason as well.
2. Review Understanding the Parts of Medicare and the TPL Guide document for more information
regarding Medicare entitlement.
Alert #434: Interface Record:
The Interface Record is run monthly and includes SDX, BDE, IUC, and Long-Term Care (LTC) rate changes.
When this alert is received for BDE the worker must:
1. Compare the payment amount shown in BDE to what is shown in Unearned Income in the Expert
system in NFOCUS, and then confirm the payment amount is appearing in the NFOCUS budgets
correctly (not double counting or missing, etc.)
a. If the payment amounts match, no action needs to be taken.
b. If the payment amounts do not match:
i. Update the amount in Unearned Income in Expert to the current BDE amount.
ii. Process budgets accordingly.
The worker must review the BDE Interface screens and may need to review multiple lines on the BDE (benefit
screen) to ensure we are accounting for the individual possibly receiving benefits from multiple claim numbers
or off of a different claim number than their own. The Medicaid Claim Number may be different than a number
designated for the client because the individual may be drawing benefits off of another individual’s claim
(example: may be eligible for benefits off of their spouse’s claim number instead of their own due to age, etc.).
See the screenshot below:
Alert #456: Benefits Suspended:
SSA benefits were suspended on the client listed on the alert.
1. Review policy regulations to determine if the client remains eligible for assistance in any other Medicaid
category.
a. See the MLTC Change Management Guide for additional information.
Alert #457 – SSA Adjustment:
The SSA benefits have been reduced due to an overpayment or garnishment. See BDE for further info and enter
the Adjust Reason in the Unearned Income task before processing budgets.
1. The worker must contact SSA in order to determine the timeframe the overpayments were received.
2. Then the worker must determine whether the overpayments were received by the client while they were
receiving Medicaid.
a. The amount after deduction of the overpayment is used if the client received both Medicaid and the
other benefit at any time during which the overpayment occurred and the overpaid amount was
included in the Medicaid budget.
3. The worker must then go to Unearned Income Tab in expert and add the Adjustment Reason.
a. The Adjustment Reason will determine whether the gross or net SSA benefits should be used in the
appropriate budgets.
4. Run the budgets and send a NOA.
SECTION 5: Miscellaneous
Early Retirement vs. Disability:
The BDE interface may report a Disability Date for some clients between the ages of 62-64. This disability date
may appear that the client is receiving SSA income based on a disability when they actually are receiving an
early retirement payment. If new SSA income is reported for clients between the age of 62-64, review the
Interfaces WINK-ed to determine if the client is determined disabled. If income is from Early Retirement, this
would not make the client categorically eligible for Non-MAGI. Client could remain in MAGI eligibility. If the
individual is only receiving Medicare, it does not mean they have been determined to be disabled by SSA. See
Policy Memo 23-02 and the SRT Guide for additional information.
Garnishments:
Non-MAGI: Income which is being intercepted, withheld, or garnished, even if done pursuant to a court order,
is counted in determining eligibility. 477 NAC 22-002.05
Garnishments and Overpayments – The amount after deduction of the overpayment is used if the client
received both Medicaid and the other benefit at any time during which the overpayment occurred, and the
overpaid amount was included in the Medicaid budget. See additional information above in this guide for Alert
#457.
