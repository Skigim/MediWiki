## Continued: Income and Deductions Verified by IRS Tax/Hub

**How to run attested income against the IRS Tax/Hub:**

After entering income and deductions run the budget:

**If the income passes the IRS Tax/Hub:**
- The budget will be marked with a '+' on the authorization screen
- View each budget separately prior to authorizing by double clicking on the budget
- If a budget has passed the IRS Tax/Hub the words "IRS Returned Income Would Have Passed" will display on the left side of the screen
- No further verification of income or deductions are needed

**If the attested income/deductions do not pass the IRS Tax/Hub:**
- A 'v' will appear on the authorization screen indicating further verification(s) are necessary
- When income is not Hub verified proceed to the Non-Hub Verified Income section

**If budget is correct:**
- Determine eligibility
- View unit size and compare to tax household
- Authorize budget
- Create Notice of Action
- If retro is requested, process Retro Medicaid. See the [Retroactive Medicaid Process](Retroactive%20Medicaid%20Process.md)
- Check Case in and Continue to the Review Date section of this guide

**NOTE:** Children are ineligible for CHIP if they are enrolled in other health insurance. This does not apply to continuously eligible children.

• If children are determined eligible for CHIP and have current Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM) coverage, eligibility may be determined and coverage overlap while the individual's FFM insurance is terminated. If the household indicates they have insurance and no further information is provided, follow-up is needed to determine the type of insurance coverage (e.g., employer-sponsored coverage or FFM coverage) and if the policy is still current. This information is also found in the TPL section below.

### Step 11: Non-Hub Verified Income {#magi-non-hub-income}

**VCI / TALX:**

If the income is not IRS Tax/Hub compatible attempt verification using VCI/TALX. Ping VCI/TALX for all HH members (14 years of age and older) currently listed as "In HH" that show up on the "Verify Current Income" screen.

**If income is verified by VCI/TALX:**
- Enter paystubs in the Expert system based on the information retrieved by VCI and Average/Convert the income
- The Verifications source in Expert should be updated to 'TALX file viewed'
- The pay schedule should contain the same pay frequency that is reported through VCI (e.g., if VCI shows a bi-weekly pay schedule, create a bi-weekly pay schedule in Expert)
- If income is verified by VCI/TALX, and retroactive Medicaid is requested, use Actual Only income from VCI/TALX in the retro months. See the [Retroactive Medicaid Process](Retroactive%20Medicaid%20Process.md)

**When VCI returns income, it is usually considered verified except in the following instances:**
- If VCI shows less than a month's worth of income
- If VCI shows income that does not fit the pay schedule, a phone call to the individual may be necessary to clarify the income

**Multiple income sources:**
- Some individuals may have more than one income, meaning SEW and DI may also need reviewed to discern if there are multiple sources of income
- **TOOL:** Income Handling Part II

**If VCI/TALX returns no results or income is unable to verified:**
- Proceed to the next level of income verification (SEW)

**SEW (STATE EMPLOYER WAGE):**

If the income is not Tax/Hub compatible and is unable to be verified through VCI/TALX, compare the attested income against the most recent SEW Quarter (divide SEW by 3 to obtain a monthly total).

**If the attested income is Reasonably Compatible with the most recent SEW Quarter:**
- Enter the attested income and leave 'unverified'
- Run the budget using the Pay Schedule calculation and check the 'Verified by SEW' box
- For more information: See the SEW Compatibility Calculator or Income Handling WINK-ed Part I for further information
- If income is found to be SEW compatible, also use the attested pay schedule for determining eligibility for retro months. See the [Retroactive Medicaid Process](Retroactive%20Medicaid%20Process.md)

**If income is not Reasonably Compatible with SEW:**
- First attempt a call the individual to obtain an amended attestation of income to compare to SEW
- If calling the individual does not result in income being reasonably compatible with SEW move to the next level income verification

**If SEW shows income not attested to on the application:**
- Look for collateral verification sources for this income (next section)
- If Collateral Verifications do not exist, call the individual to clarify and get attestation of this income
- Reasonable Explanation can be used if the individual claims the income ended in a month prior to months where MED is requested
- If SEW shows unreported/unattested income and the worker is unable to get ahold of the HH for an attestation, this should be treated as a lead only. Further verification (e.g., VR) would be required prior to utilizing the income in the budget

**PAPER/COLLATERAL VERIFICATION:**

If electronic interfaces (Tax/Hub, VCI/TALX and SEW) are unable to verify income the next level of verification is Paper/Collateral Verification.

**This can include:**
- Verification/documentation found in document imaging
- Narratives (both MLTC and EA)
- Recent applications submitted (both MLTC and EA)
- Employer contact (Telephonic employer income verification or TEIV)

**Steps for utilizing previous collateral verification:**
- Check Document imaging for paystubs or other employment verification
- Check recent prior narratives for both Medicaid and Economic Assistance. Narratives can also contain the individual's attested end date for employment
- Check recent applications submitted to both MLTC and EA
- Call employer directly

**Missing Paystubs:**
- If the individual provided paystubs that are consecutive, however missing a paystub between the paystubs provided, use the Missing Paystub Year-to-Date Calculator to determine the gross amount of the missing paystub instead of sending a VR

**Self-employment:**
- If attested SE income did not pass the Tax/Hub, paper verification is needed
- First attempt to obtain ledgers via phone call to the individual
- If unable to reach the individual send a VR requesting verification of self-employment income, ledgers or their most recent tax returns, including all schedules
- For additional information, see the [Self-Employment Guide](Self-Employment%20Guide.md)
- See the MAGI and Non-MAGI – SE Calculator to figure income based on ledgers
- For more information on how to handle self-employment involving S-corp/partnerships, see MAGI Partnership and S-corp Income

**VERIFICATION REQUESTS (VRs):**
- If unable to verify income through electronic data sources and paper/collateral forms of verification, send a Verification Request (VR)
- Every effort should be made to verify income before sending a VR

### Step 12: Retroactive Medicaid Process {#magi-retroactive}

• Review the application for any retroactive Medicaid requests.

• Do not pend a retro program case until an eligibility determination can be made (eligible or ineligible).

• Any Authorized/Case Representative will need to be added to the separate Retro MED Program Case.

• Detailed information and procedures on Retroactive Medicaid can be found in the [Retroactive Medicaid Process](Retroactive%20Medicaid%20Process.md) Guide.

### Step 13: Deductions {#magi-deductions}

• Allowable MAGI Deductions are found in the Appendix NAC 477-000-008. Additional examples, maximum amounts allowed and how to verify are in the MAGI Deduction Guide.

**Pre-Tax Deductions:**
- Some payroll Deductions are always considered Pre-Tax Deductions and, if listed on a paystub, are allowable
- These include Health Savings Accounts (HSA) and Accident or Health Plan (Medical, Dental, Vision)

**Initial determinations should be made without waiting for verification of the deduction(s) IF the HH is eligible without using the deduction(s).**
- Add a comment to the Notice of Action to inform the applicant they have the option to provide additional verifications in order for the deduction(s) to be used in eligibility determinations

**Calculating MAGI Deductions:**

The computation of deductions are handled in the same manner as the computation of income.

- Deductions which vary must be averaged / converted
- If using 30 or 90 day average for income, use the same 30 or 90 day average to compute deductions (example: 401K deductions are determined by a percentage of income)
- **Retroactive Deductions:** The calculation of the deductions must match the calculation method used for the income in the retroactive months. If a retroactive budget is approved using paystubs with "Actual Only" as the calculation method, deductions must match the actual amounts from those paystubs without converting them to a monthly amount

**Entering deductions when income is verified by IRS Tax/Hub:**

When processing initial applications, attested deductions must be entered and combined into one entry:
- Specify the type of deduction in the "description" field
- The verification source for the attested deduction should be "Client Statement"

**Entering deductions when income is not verified by IRS Tax/Hub:**

When VCI/TALX, SEW or Paper Documentation is used to verify income, each deduction should be entered separately.
- Each verified deduction type should be entered under the "Expense" module in expert under "MAGI Expenses" from the drop-down menu, choose option "other deductions"
- The deduction must be verified using the appropriate verification source. Remember, the computation of deductions is handled in the same manner as the computation of income
- When deductions are verified with tax documents, configure an annualized deduction schedule verified by tax returns

### Step 14: Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) {#magi-mec}

• Review the application to determine if there is qualified health coverage for all of the children OR they will be eligible for Medicaid when the budget is processed. Attestation of MEC for a dependent child is acceptable unless there is questionable information. See MEC vs Creditable Coverage.

**Yes:** If all the children are covered by MEC or will be eligible for Medicaid, the P/CR will be eligible to be considered for MAGI Expansion.

**No:** If any of the children are not covered by MEC or eligible for Medicaid, the parent will not be considered for MAGI Expansion eligibility.

---

### Step 15: Third Party Liability (TPL) {#magi-tpl}

• Check to see if any applicants are covered by TPL. If applicants with TPL are approved, policy information MUST be entered into C1. See the [TPL Guide](TPL%20Guide.md) and [C1 TPL Quick Reference Guide](C1%20TPL%20Quick%20Reference%20Guide.md) for further information.

**Review TPL information:**
- Application should be reviewed to determine if the household has provided adequate TPL information to add insurance to C1
- Review Document Imaging (DI) for copies of the card which may have already been provided
- C1 may be reviewed to determine if policy was already entered

**If information is not available:**
- Attempt call to the individual to obtain the needed information
- A call-out to the TPL provider may also be appropriate if you are attempting to verify minimal information, such as: start date/end date, who is covered, etc.
- As a last resort, send a VR requesting a copy of the insurance card
  - **Do not delay processing of the case if the insurance card or other policy information is all that is needed.** Process the case and then send a VR requesting TPL verification
  - If the VR for TPL information is not received, any active adults in the case covered by the TPL should be closed for "Failed to Provide Information". Children are not affected by FTP TPL information and must remain open

**CHIP Eligibility:**

Children are ineligible for CHIP if they are enrolled in other creditable health insurance (TPL). This does not apply to continuously eligible children.

- However, if children are determined eligible for CHIP, and have current Federally Facilitated Marketplace (FFM) coverage, eligibility may be determined and coverage overlap while the individual's FFM insurance is terminated. Once approved for Medicaid, an account transfer is sent to the Marketplace to inform them of the eligibility decision
- If the household indicates they have insurance and no further information is provided, follow-up is needed to determine the type of insurance coverage (e.g., employer-sponsored coverage or FFM coverage) and if this is still a current policy prior to processing children into CHIP
