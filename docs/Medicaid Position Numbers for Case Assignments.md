## Key Definitions

**Position Number:** A specialized queue identifier used to assign specific types of Medicaid cases to designated staff with expertise in those areas. Cases are assigned to position numbers to ensure proper handling by specialized workers.

**Universal Caseload (UC):** Standard case assignment for general Medicaid cases that do not require specialized handling. Most routine cases remain in universal caseload unless specific circumstances require assignment to a position number.

**Application Manager:** Staff responsible for initial application intake and processing. Application Managers do not need to narrate unless specified in the Application Management Medicaid Guide or there are special circumstances.

**Master Case:** The primary case record in NFOCUS that contains all Medicaid program cases for a household. All Medicaid program cases within the Master Case must be assigned to a position number when making referrals.

**Work Task:** System-generated task created in NFOCUS requiring worker action. Work tasks associated with cases being assigned to position numbers should be marked "Completed" before assignment, unless otherwise noted.

**Specialized Staff (SSW):** Staff with specialized training and expertise assigned to handle specific types of cases, such as Spousal Impoverishment (SIMP), MIWD, or waiver cases.
