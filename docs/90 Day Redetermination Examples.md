# 90-Day Redetermination Examples
*Practical Q&A for Processing Cases Within the 90-Day Verification Period*

## Overview

This guide provides practical examples and answers to common questions about processing Medicaid cases within the 90-day redetermination period. The 90-day period allows individuals to provide requested verifications or reopen cases without needing a new application when eligibility requirements are met.

Understanding these scenarios helps staff correctly process cases when verifications are received late, cases need to be reopened, or renewals are due during the 90-day window. The examples cover situations involving late verification submission, case reopening, and verification request management.

**90-Day Period** – The timeframe following case closure during which an individual may provide verifications or reopen their case without submitting a new application

**Failed to Provide Information** – Case closure reason when requested verifications are not received by the due date

**Retroactive Medicaid** – Medicaid coverage for up to three months prior to the application month when requested and eligibility requirements are met

**Review Due Date** – The date by which a renewal must be completed to maintain continuous coverage

**Verification Request (VR)** – Official request for documentation to verify eligibility; includes a due date

**VR Due Date** – The deadline for providing requested verifications; does not change when a VR is resent

## Late Verification Submission

### Q1: Verifications Received Within 90 Days of Application

**Scenario:** An individual submitted a Medicaid application on 9/13/2025. Verifications were not received by the VR due date, so the case was denied for "Failed to Provide Information" effective 9/2025. The verifications are then provided on 11/6/2025, which is within 90 days of the application date.

**Question:** What date do we process the application from?

**Answer:** If all eligibility requirements are met, Medicaid is processed for the application month (9/2025) and forward, using the original application date of 9/13/2025 in Expert. The renewal due date would be set for 8/31/2026.

## Retroactive Medicaid Considerations

### Q2: Processing Retroactive Medicaid After Late Verification Submission

**Scenario:** Following Q1, the verifications were submitted on 11/6/2025 for an application originally dated 9/13/2025.

**Question:** Does the worker need to process Retroactive Medicaid for the initial application months (June-August 2025)?

**Answer:** Yes, the worker would also need to look to see if a retroactive request was made on the initial application dated 9/13/2025. The worker would be looking at possibly processing Retroactive Medicaid for June, July, and August 2025 if this was requested on the application or if it was verbally requested by the individual within 6 months from the application date.

**Reference:** Review the [Retroactive Medicaid Process](Retroactive%20Medicaid%20Process.md) and [WINK-ed Retroactive Medicaid](WINK-ed%20Retroactive%20Medicaid.md) for additional information.

## Case Reopening Scenarios

### Q3: Family Returns Within 90 Days of Moving Out of State

**Scenario:** An individual called to report that he and his family moved out of state as of 10/1/2025. On 12/15/2025, he calls back to report that they moved back because the job did not work out. Their last renewal was in August 2025 and the Review Due date was updated to 8/31/2026 at that time. There have been no changes to the filing unit.

**Question:** Is a new application required?

**Answer:** No, the case can be reopened without needing a new application as the individuals in the household have been closed for less than 90 days. The case would be reopened for the first month all residency requirements are met. The Review Due date should be set for 8/31/2026 so the case remains on the same renewal cycle.

### Q4: Case Reopening Without Verifications

**Scenario:** A case is closed for "Failed to Provide Information." On day 45, the individual calls to see if their case can be reopened but has not provided any of the requested verifications.

**Question:** Can the case be reopened?

**Answer:** No, if all of the requested verifications have not been provided, the case cannot be reopened. The worker will re-send the verification request (VR) to the individual to remind them of the verifications that are due. The VR due date will not change.

> ⚠️ **Important:** DO NOT CREATE A NEW VR.

## Verification Request Management

### Q5: Approaching End of 90-Day Period Without Verifications

**Scenario:** Following Q4, on day 85, the individual calls again and still has not provided the requested verifications.

**Question:** How long do they have to provide the information requested? Is a new application required?

**Answer:** The individual would have 5 days to provide all of the requested verifications. The Medicaid case cannot be reopened. The worker would re-send the VR to the individual reminding them that all previously requested verifications are needed.

> ⚠️ **Important:** DO NOT CREATE A NEW VR.

If verifications are not submitted within 5 days, a new application will be required.

### Tip: Using Resend Comments Effectively

Under the "Add Resend Comments" on the Verification Request, clearly state:
- What the individual needs to provide
- The date they need to provide their verifications by before needing a new application

By doing this, it will assist the individual in not completing any duplicate applications and getting their verifications back before day 90.

## Renewal During 90-Day Period

### Q6: Renewal Due During 90-Day Period with Reported Change

**Scenario:** An individual and their family have an ongoing case. Their last renewal was completed in May 2024. A VR was sent for verification of new employment due March 5th, 2025. The information was not provided and the case was closed for April 2025. On June 2nd, 2025, the individual calls to report that they had a reduction in hours because of cut backs and would like the case reopened.

**Question:** Does the individual need to reapply?

**Answer:** The individual would have until 6/30/2025 (90 days from the closure date) to provide:
- Income verification, AND
- A renewal form (or application) since a review would have been due in April 2025

**If Medicaid was needed for April 2025 or May 2025:**
- Verification of income for those months would also be required, due to there being a reported change

**If income was stable in those months:**
- Only 30 days of reflective income is needed
