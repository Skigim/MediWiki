## Section 1: Transfers to Disabled or Blind Children

### Q1: Is there a limit to the amount of resources that can be transferred to the applicant or client's blind or disabled child without it being considered a deprivation?

**Answer:**

No, there is no limit to the amount of resources that can be transferred.

**Regulatory Basis:**
Per 477 NAC 23-003.04(K), if the transfer was made to their child/stepchild and that individual has been determined to be blind or disabled per the Social Security Administration, there is **no limit** to the amount of resources that can be transferred directly to them or to a trust established solely for their benefit.

**Key Requirements:**

1. **Recipient must be child or stepchild** of the transferor
2. **Recipient must be determined blind or disabled by SSA** at the time of transfer
3. **Transfer can be made:**
   - Directly to the blind or disabled child, OR
   - To a trust established solely for their benefit

**Documentation:**
- SSA determination of blindness or disability must be verified
- Relationship as child/stepchild must be documented
- Transfer details and amounts must be recorded in case narrative

**This exception protects parents' ability to provide for disabled children without Medicaid penalty.**

## Section 2: Verification Requirements

### Q2: Attestation is now accepted as verification of a nursing home trust account balance. When would we need to send a VR or call the facility to verify the balance?

**Answer:**

While attestation is generally accepted, verification may be needed in specific circumstances.

**When to Request Verification:**

**Scenario 1: Ineligibility Threshold**
- If the attested balance of the nursing home trust, when combined with other verified resources, would make the client ineligible
- Verification might be needed to ensure accurate resource determination

**Scenario 2: Questionable Information**
- If there is questionable information about the attested balance
- Verification needed to resolve discrepancies or concerns

**Scenario 3: Income Deposit Account Changes**
- If the nursing home trust was the account in which the monthly income had been deposited AND the client has attested they no longer have this account
- Follow up may be needed to determine where the income is now being deposited
- Ensures proper tracking of income and prevents unreported resource accumulation

**General Rule:**
Accept attestation unless one of the above circumstances applies.

### Q3: Does fair market value have to be reviewed on an otherwise excludable vehicle type if it is sold, traded or given away?

**Answer:**

Yes. Fair market value must be reviewed for all vehicle transfers, including excludable vehicles.

**Verification Requirements:**

1. **Ownership Verification:**
   - Ownership of excludable motor vehicles can be verified by client attestation
   - Must be documented in case narrative

2. **FMV Determination:**
   - Use the trade-in value listed in Kelly Blue Book
   - Provides standardized valuation method

3. **Mileage Estimation:**
   - Use 12,000 miles per year to determine the mileage if:
     - Mileage was not attested, AND
     - Mileage is unavailable in the DMV interface
   - This standard estimation ensures fair valuation

**Why This Matters:**
Even though a vehicle is excludable as a resource for eligibility purposes, selling, trading, or giving it away for less than fair market value can still constitute deprivation. The excludable status relates to counting it as a resource, not to whether it can be transferred without penalty.

**Documentation:**
Document vehicle type, sale price, FMV determination method, mileage used, and any compensation received.

## Section 3: Level of Care and Living Arrangement Changes

### Q4: Does an ineligibility period based on a resource deprivation get recalculated if the individual's Level of Care (LOC) or living arrangement changes?

**Answer:**

The period of ineligibility is generally fixed, but can be recalculated in specific circumstances.

**General Rule:**

The period of ineligibility is determined at the point in time where the agency has a valid application or request for coverage of institutionalized care and the individual is otherwise eligible for Medicaid, except for the deprivation.

**When Recalculation Can Occur:**

If an applicant experiences a **significant increase** in their private pay level at some point during their period of ineligibility, we **can recalculate** the time left to be served based on the new LOC.

**Regulatory Reference:** 477 NAC 23-003.04(H)

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Move to Higher-Cost Facility**
- Individual serving penalty at facility with $250/day private rate
- Moves to specialized care facility with $400/day private rate
- Remaining penalty period can be recalculated based on higher rate
- Results in shorter remaining time period

**Scenario 2: Level of Care Upgrade**
- Individual moves from assisted living to nursing facility
- Higher nursing facility rate applies
- Penalty period can be recalculated

**Important Clarification:**

The original penalty amount (total deprivation) does not change. What changes is:
- The monthly/daily rate used for calculation
- The number of months/days remaining to serve
- Not the dollar amount of the original transfer

**Documentation:**
- Document original penalty calculation
- Document change in LOC or facility rate
- Document recalculation showing new remaining penalty period
- Include all calculations in case narrative

## Section 4: Waiver Withdrawal and Penalty Options

### Q5: Can a client opt to withdraw their waiver request in order to not serve the penalty period?

**Answer:**

It depends on whether the deprivation penalty has been imposed (client noticed).

**BEFORE Penalty Imposed (Client NOT Yet Noticed):**

**If a deprivation of resources has been determined, but not yet imposed:**
- Client has NOT been noticed
- Client **CAN withdraw** their waiver request
- Client can remain in a Medicaid Spenddown budget
- Penalty is not served

**AFTER Penalty Imposed (Client Noticed):**

**If the deprivation of resources penalty has been imposed:**
- Client has been noticed
- Client **CANNOT withdraw** their waiver request
- The deprivation penalty **must remain and be served**
- This results in their Medicaid case closing
- Once the penalty period lapses, the client may reapply

**Critical Timing:**

The key distinction is whether the Notice of Action imposing the penalty has been sent to the client. Once noticed, the withdrawal option is no longer available.

**Reference:**
For additional information please refer to the Deprivation of Resources Process Guide.

**Planning Considerations:**

Staff should discuss this option with clients during the deprivation determination process, before sending the Notice of Action, so clients can make informed decisions about whether to proceed with waiver request.

### Q6: Does the individual pay the private pay rate to the facility during the penalty period?

**Answer:**

Yes, if residing in a facility. However, there is an alternative option.

**If Individual Resides in Facility During Penalty Period:**

Once the penalty period has been determined, the individual will pay the private pay rate during that period if they are in a facility.

**Alternative Option - Family Care:**

The individual has the option to reside outside of a facility under family care while they serve out their penalty period.

**Important Limitations During Penalty Period:**

Regardless of where they reside during the penalty period, they would **NOT be eligible** for:
- AABD (Aid to Aged, Blind and Disabled)
- SLMB (Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary)
- QI-1 (Qualifying Individual - 1)

**Why This Matters:**

This option allows individuals to avoid paying the high private pay rate at a facility by:
- Living with family members or in their own home
- Receiving care from family or private caregivers
- Serving the penalty period without facility costs

However, they still cannot receive Medicaid assistance during this time, even for community-based categories.

**Planning Implications:**

- Families should be informed of this option during penalty determination
- Allows for financial planning and arrangement of alternative care
- Some individuals may choose to serve penalty at home to preserve assets
- Once penalty period ends, individual can reapply for Medicaid with waiver

## Key Takeaways

✓ **No Limit for Disabled Children:** Unlimited resources can be transferred to blind or disabled child (or trust for their benefit) without deprivation penalty if SSA has determined disability

✓ **Nursing Home Trust Attestation:** Generally accepted for balance verification; request additional verification only if attested balance would cause ineligibility, information is questionable, or income deposit account changed

✓ **Excludable Vehicle FMV Review Required:** All vehicle sales must be reviewed for FMV even if vehicle was excludable resource; use Kelly Blue Book trade-in value and 12,000 miles/year if mileage unknown

✓ **Penalty Recalculation Allowed:** Period of ineligibility can be recalculated if individual experiences significant increase in private pay rate during penalty period (shorter time, same dollar amount)

✓ **Withdrawal Timing Critical:** Client can withdraw waiver request to avoid penalty ONLY before Notice of Action sent; after notice, penalty must be served and Medicaid case closes

✓ **Private Pay During Penalty:** Individual pays full private pay rate if residing in facility during penalty; alternative is to reside outside facility under family care

✓ **No Medicaid Categories During Penalty:** During penalty period, individual not eligible for AABD, SLMB, or QI-1 regardless of living arrangement

✓ **Fixed Penalty Amount:** Original deprivation amount doesn't change; only the time period changes if private pay rate increases significantly

✓ **Documentation Essential:** All transfers to disabled children, vehicle sales, penalty calculations, and recalculations must be thoroughly documented in case narrative

✓ **Reapplication After Penalty:** Once penalty period lapses, individual may reapply for Medicaid with or without waiver request
