# Resource Verification

**Resource Verification & Documentation**  
*Comprehensive guide to verifying resources for Non-MAGI Medicaid eligibility*

---

## Overview

Resource verification must be completed prior to running budgets and determining eligibility to ensure an accurate eligibility determination is made. All resource ownership must be documented in NFOCUS narratives.

**Non-MAGI program eligibility** requires staff to review resources at initial and ongoing eligibility determinations for persons with disabilities, aging adults, and individuals who are medically needy with a share of cost (477 NAC 23-003.02 - Verification of Resources).

**Supplemental Security Income (SSI) Exception**: SSI recipients and individuals in 1619(b) status are exempt from resource review because the Social Security Administration (SSA) monitors the recipient's income and resources (477 NAC 23-003.02(A) - Exceptions).

**Primary Verification Source**: The Asset Verification Service (AVS) must be used as the primary source of verification, if available, to verify assets at initial application, renewal, and for changes to accounts or certain living arrangements. See [AVS Procedural Guide](AVS%20Procedural%20Guide.md) for additional information.

**Budgets Updated by Economic Assistance**: Budgets must also be reviewed for resources that have been updated by Economic Assistance (EA) Staff.

## Key Definitions

**Asset Verification Service (AVS)**: Electronic system used as primary source to verify financial accounts and property at application, renewal, and for changes to living arrangements.

**Sole Ownership**: Designation on a resource that means an individual is the only owner of the resource.

**Joint Ownership**: Designation on a resource that means two or more individuals share ownership of the resource; also known as joint tenancy and tenancy in common.

**Payable on Death (POD)**: Designation on a resource that automatically transfers the resource to a beneficiary upon death of all account owners and co-owners; also known as Transfer on Death (TOD) and Totten Trust.

**Lowest Daily Balance**: Lowest account balance during a specific month, used when individual has excess resources to reduce countable amount.

**Encumbrance**: Deduction of deposited income from account balance when determining countable resources (subject to specific rules for institutionalized individuals).

**Fair Market Value (FMV)**: Price at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and willing seller, neither being under compulsion to buy or sell.

**Deprivation of Resources**: Transfer, sale, or change of ownership for which fair market value is not received by an individual requesting coverage of long-term care; subject to 60-month lookback period.

**Life Estate**: Real property in which client/spouse has "life interest"; identified on deed by words "life use" or "for use."

**Land Lease**: Property owned by applicant that is being rented out; equity value is countable resource.

**Land Contract**: Agreement when seller of property also finances the purchase; contract subject to specific conditions, payments counted as unearned income.

- Requesting assistance
- Filed the correct application
- Submitted any required verifications

**Resource Questions on Applications**:
- Application will NOT ask resource questions if individual is under age 65 or does not indicate physical or mental disability
- Resource attestation and AVS Consent can be obtained by calling individual using Consent Line (see [MLTC Consent Line Process Guide](MLTC%20Consent%20Line%20Process%20Guide.md))

### Form Options for Resource Information

**MILTC-63**:
- Used to obtain resource information for individual who would like Non-MAGI determination
- Required if individual wants to add person to case at renewal (used in conjunction with MILTC-51)
- See Policy Memo dated 05/01/2014 - "Adding a Person to a Medicaid Case" on MERL

**MILTC-51**:
- Does NOT ask for any resource information
- Only requests information needed to make MAGI eligibility determination
- Resource information and AVS Consent can be obtained via phone call using Consent Line or on MILTC-63 for Non-MAGI determination

**Refer to [Standalone Application Chart](Standalone%20Application%20Chart.md) for more information.**

---

## Verification Policy

### When Resource Verification Required

**Initial Application**: All countable resources must be verified

**Renewal**: Resources must be re-verified at each renewal

**Changes**: Resource verification required when:
- Change in living arrangement reported (e.g., institutionalized care)
- Worker must review if resources may be losing their exclusion (such as home or vehicle)
- Ownership and equity value of resource must be verified if exclusion will be lost

### Primary Verification Source

**Asset Verification Service (AVS)** must be used as primary source when available:

**FI Network Nebraska Resources:**
- Financial institutions participating in AVS can be found at: FI Network Nebraska
- Accounts unable to be verified by AVS, Early Warning banks, and limited participation banks documented in FI Network Nebraska

See [AVS Procedural Guide](AVS%20Procedural%20Guide.md) and [Expedited AVS Process Reasons](Expedited%20AVS%20Process%20Reasons.md) for complete procedures.

## Terms of Ownership

Understanding different ownership types for resources is critical to ensure resources are either included or excluded correctly in Medicaid budgeting.

### Sole Ownership

**Definition**: A designation on a resource that means an individual is the only owner of the resource.

**Example**: Mary Smith is the sole owner on this bank account.

### Joint Ownership

**Definition**: A designation on a resource that means two or more individuals share ownership of the resource.

**Also known as**: Joint tenancy and tenancy in common

**Example**: Mary and David Bienz are joint owners on this account.

### Payable on Death (POD)

**Definition**: A designation on a resource that automatically transfers the resource to a beneficiary upon the death of all account owners and co-owners.

**Also known as**: Transfer on Death (TOD) and Totten Trust

**Key Characteristics**:
- Allows for by-passing probate court (protects resource from estate recovery)
- Voids other estate planning/will designations

**Example**: John Smith is the sole account owner. When he passes away his account will be payable on death (POD) to his sister Jane Smith.

### POD on Property - NOT Allowed

**Important Restriction**: POD is **not allowable** as an ownership designation on property for Medicaid eligibility per Neb. Rev. Stat. § 68-919.

**Action Required**: An individual applying for or receiving Nebraska Medicaid **must update** their resource ownership to remove Payable on Death if they have POD as a designation on property they own.

**NOTE - Bank Accounts**: Staff must **not** take action on requiring individual to update POD designation on bank accounts. These accounts are subject to review through the Estate Recovery process.

---

## Verification Procedures

### Required Information on Account Statements

Clarification was added to [AVS Procedural Guide](AVS%20Procedural%20Guide.md) regarding information needed on account statement for adequate account verification.

**AVS response must be used as primary source** for verification, if available. Refer to AVS Procedural Guide to determine when phone and/or paper verification is required.

**If phone and/or paper verification needed**, request most recent monthly statement with ending monthly balance. Statement should include:

1. **Client name**
2. **Financial institution or bank name**
3. **Statement date**
4. **Account number** (at least the last 3 digits if applicable)
5. **Account balance**

**Common Error**: Incomplete account statements are a common error trend found in NEARS reviews.

### Conference Calls for Verification

If account statement is not available, **conference call** with financial institution may be completed to verify:
- Bank account
- Guardian/Conservator account
- ABLE (ENable) account
- Investment account

### Client Attestation Acceptable For

**Client attestation is acceptable** for following accounts, **unless information is questionable or results in excess resources** (see Medicaid Resource Verification Plan):

- **Direct Express**
- **ReliaCard**
- **Nursing home accounts**

**Documentation Required**: This information must be documented in narrative.

### Mobile Payment/Digital Wallet Accounts

**Examples**: Venmo, PayPal, Cash App, Zelle, etc.

**Nature**: Person-to-person payment network

**Worker Actions**:
1. **Determine from conversation** with individual if account is business or personal
   - **If business related** (Ex: hairdresser, nail technician, etc.) - may indicate employment

## Lowest Daily Balance vs. Encumbrance

To eliminate confusion when entering account balances, the following process must be followed:

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1**: Refer to [AVS Procedural Guide](AVS%20Procedural%20Guide.md) to determine when phone and/or paper verification is required.

**Step 2**: Enter ending account balance(s) from AVS or bank/financial institution statement(s).

**Step 3**: If result is that individual has **excess resources** for their current Medicaid category, then use **lowest daily account balance**.

**Step 4**: If individual **still has excess resources** using lowest daily balance, then **encumber the account** with any deposited income.

**Step 5**: Refer to MRVP for additional guidance.

### Exception for Institutionalized Care

**For individuals receiving institutionalized care**, deposited income can only be used as encumbrance if obligations such as SOC or POS have **not been paid** for the month by the date of the lowest daily balance used.

---

## Account Balance and Deposited Income Deduction

### Exception for Institutionalized Living Arrangement

There is an exception to deducting deposited income for individuals who reside in institutionalized living arrangement.

**Rule**: For individuals in institutionalized living arrangement, their income must **not be deducted** if their POS/SOC has already been paid to facility by date of lowest balance.

**Why?**

In these situations, POS/SOC is an obligation of individual's income to pay for their care. If agency allowed deposited income to be deducted from lowest balance, it would be "double deducting" same income:
- Once when POS/SOC was paid
- Again from lowest balance

### Personal Needs Allowance Deduction

**If not deducting income has impact on eligibility**, deduct individual's **personal needs allowance** from lowest daily balance.

**Why?**

- Individual's personal needs allowance is NOT obligated to pay for their care
- However, amount is still included in individual's deposited income that is counted in their budget
- Thus, individual gets full month before this income is counted as resource
- Agency must deduct amount from lowest daily balance, if necessary

### Bank Statement Review for LTC

**If reviewing bank statements**, and individual is receiving institutionalized care (LTC), bank statements must be reviewed for **resource transfers**.

**Action**: Additional information may be needed if transfers are present, as this could indicate resource deprivation.

See [Deprivation of Resources Process Guide](Deprivation%20of%20Resources%20Process%20Guide.md) for additional information.

---

## Deprivation of Resources

**Deprivation of Resources**: A transfer, sale, or change of ownership for which fair market value is not received by an individual requesting coverage of long-term care is reviewed for deprivation of resources sanction.

**Fair market value** of resource at time resource was disposed of must be verified.

See [Deprivation of Resources Process Guide](Deprivation%20of%20Resources%20Process%20Guide.md) for complete information.

### Examples of Deprivation

- Recorded transfer of ownership of real property
- Not receiving spousal share of augmented estate
- Purchase of life estate in another individual's home without meeting 12-month requirement to reside there
- Promissory notes, loans, mortgages, and contract sales for less than fair market value or which are for at least fair market value and are not enforced
- Purchase of irrevocable, non-assignable annuity, if Medicaid is not preferred beneficiary and annuity is issued on or after February 8, 2006
- Purchase of any contract or financial instrument, including endowment or insurance, where criteria for fair market value are not met
- Resources transferred to pooled trust established for benefit of person 65 years old or greater at time of transfer
- Any transfer above protected spousal reserved amount to community spouse
- Transfer or sale of life insurance policies for less than fair market value
- Transfer or gift of any resource to third party for less than fair market value

### 60-Month Lookback Period

When individual goes into institutionalized living arrangement, **60-month lookback period** must be completed on all resources to determine potential deprivation.

**AVS Automatic Lookback**: AVS will automatically search 60 months back if 'Request Type' is submitted as **NA** or **SA**.

### AVS Transfer Flags

If AVS shows flags indicating transfers, **bank statements must be requested and reviewed**. During review, worker must:
- Attempt to reconcile transfer amount
- Review other leads to unreported resources, income or expenses

**Deprivation findings** must be correctly calculated, and details documented under Deprivation narrative sub-heading.

### Not Currently in Specified Living Arrangement

When individual is **not currently residing** in specified living arrangement (therefore not subject to penalty period) and transfer of assets is discovered or suspected:
- Details must be documented

See [Deprivation of Resources Process Guide](Deprivation%20of%20Resources%20Process%20Guide.md) and [Charitable Giving Guidance](Charitable%20Giving%20Guidance.md) for additional details.
