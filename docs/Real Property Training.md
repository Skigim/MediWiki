*Comprehensive Guide to Real Property Ownership, Verification, and Eligibility*

## Overview

This comprehensive guide provides staff with detailed information on real property ownership, verification requirements, and eligibility considerations for Non-MAGI Medicaid participants. Real property includes land and any structures, improvements, or crops growing on the land.

Understanding property ownership types, verification methods, exclusion criteria, and the liquidation process is essential for accurate eligibility determinations. This guide covers all aspects of real property from initial verification through complex scenarios involving life estates, spousal impoverishment, and institutional care transitions.

All manual references are from 477 NAC Chapter 23, unless noted otherwise.

**Document Date:** Updated June 2025  
**Scope:** Applies to all Non-MAGI Medicaid eligibility determinations involving real property

## Key Definitions

**Assessor** – The county office that values property for taxation purposes. The assessor notifies an individual what amount is being taxed and issues the notice of taxes due. The person who receives the tax notice is not necessarily the property owner. Medicaid generally uses the tax assessed value as the basis for valuing a property interest.

**Encumbrance** – A mortgage, lien, or other legal claim against a property that reduces its equity value. Encumbrances must be verified and documented in the case record.

**Equity** – The assessed value of the real property less the total of outstanding filed encumbrances against it (mortgages, mechanic's liens, other liens, and back taxes).

**Et al.** – Latin abbreviation meaning "and others." In property context, indicates ownership interests are spread among several parties. Not specific to any form of ownership.

**Et ux.** – Latin phrase meaning "and wife." Indicates the person owns property with their spouse, almost always indicating joint ownership.

**Grantee** – The person receiving an interest in property from the grantor.

**Grantor** – The person transferring the property interest to another.

**Lessee** – An individual renting or leasing an interest in property. The lessee does not have the right to take possession or sell the property.

**Lessor** – The owner of a property interest who is renting or leasing the interest to another party.

**Lien** – An outstanding debt secured by property or assets. A lien must be filed with the county to be valid. A lien holder could force a sale of the property but often waits until the property is sold or transferred.

**Life Estate** – A tool used in estate planning that splits ownership interest of real property. One party (life tenant) has current rights to use the property; the remainder interest is given to the remainderman.

**Life Tenant** – The party with current rights to use property in a life estate arrangement.

**Medical Institution** – An institution organized to provide medical care, including nursing and convalescent care, with necessary professional personnel, equipment, and facilities to manage medical, nursing, and health needs on a continuing basis (477 NAC 11-002.05).

**Real Property** – Land, including any structures, improvements, or crops growing on the land.

**Register of Deeds** – County office where property transfers are recorded. Can verify ownership and whether any mortgages or liens have been filed against the property.

**Remainderman** – The party receiving the remainder interest in a life estate who will own the property after the life estate ends.

## Forms of Ownership

Real property may include the rights to minerals on or below the land. An individual can own an interest in real property in a variety of ways.

### Fee Simple

Fee simple is ownership of the entire interest in property. The owner has the right to sell, transfer, or alter the property without restriction.

### Joint Tenants

Joint tenants each own an undivided interest in property:
- Each joint tenant is free to use the property
- A joint tenant cannot generally sell their interest without consent of the other joint tenant(s)
- For Medicaid, the value of jointly owned property is the **whole value divided by the number of owners**
- If a deed lists multiple owners, Nebraska law presumes joint tenancy unless the deed states otherwise
- Joint tenants have a **right of survivorship**—when one dies, the remaining joint tenant(s) inherit the property

**Example:** If two people own property as joint tenants, when the first one dies, the second becomes the sole owner.

### Tenants in Common

Tenancy in common is a form of ownership in which multiple owners each have the right to use a parcel of property:
- Shares of ownership do not need to be equal
- A tenant in common is free to sell or transfer their share without consent of other owners
- Tenants in common **do not have a right of survivorship**
- When one owner dies, their share can be willed to any party

### Life Estate

A life estate splits ownership interest of real property:
- **Life tenant** has current rights to use the property
- **Remainderman** holds the future interest
- Usually, the life estate expires upon the life tenant's death
- May be limited to a term of years or until a certain occurrence (e.g., as long as the property remains the residence, or as long as there are minor children)
- After the life estate ends, ownership transfers to the remainderman
- Verify by obtaining a copy of both the prior and current recorded deeds (477 NAC 23-003.07(A))

> 📋 **Note:** On rare occasion, life estates include financial accounts as property.

> 📋 **Out of State Property:** Submit out of state property questions to DHHS Medicaid Policy Questions.

## Verification Requirements

Real property must be verified at application, renewal, or if a change occurs for Non-MAGI participants, unless they are current pay SSI or are in 1619(b) status. See [Resource Verification](Resource%20Verification.md) for additional information.

### Deed

A recorded deed verifies ownership of a property interest:
- Indicates who transferred what type of property interest, and to whom
- May require obtaining a prior deed to determine what interest the grantor had

**Example:** If a deed transfers "my interest" to a grantee, the previous deed is needed to determine what that interest was.

### Stamp

A stamp is placed on a deed at recording to show registration and tax payment:
- The date on the stamp is when property is considered transferred, regardless of when the deed was written
- **A deed without a stamp is not considered verification of transfer**

**Example:** A deed written in 2010 that is recorded in 2018 would be considered to have transferred ownership in 2018.

### Mortgage or Deed of Trust

Property is often sold with either a mortgage or a deed of trust:
- The mortgage holder or trustee may hold the deed until the debt is paid
- May need verification from mortgage holder or trustee to verify current ownership and amount remaining

### Contract

Property can be sold or leased on contract:
- Contract sales typically happen between private parties
- Need a copy of the land contract and payment schedule to ensure compliance with 477-000-031
- Seller may delay transferring ownership until debt is paid
- For rented land, need copy of current contract to verify terms and determine countable income

### Wills and Trusts

Property commonly transferred through wills or trust agreements:
- Must still be recorded and stamped by Register of Deeds for interest to transfer
- Property transferred to a trust typically lists the trustee as grantee
- Listing property on a trust's schedule of assets is **insufficient to complete transfer**—it must be recorded
- May need a copy of will or trust to verify property interest transferred

> ⚠️ **Important:** Real property being added to the expert system must include the appropriate exclusion reason, when applicable.

---

## Excluded Property

Property is not considered a countable resource in the following situations:

### Life Estate

A life tenant or remainderman may become a Medicaid beneficiary:
- Once recorded, a life estate cannot be sold or transferred without consent of all parties
- **Life estate is generally an unavailable resource for the life tenant**
- **Remaindermen do not have rights to the property**—value is unavailable for the duration of the life estate

### Property Without Equity Value

If the value of all loans, liens, or mortgages exceeds the market value of the property, there is no countable value.

### Cost Exceeds Value

If the individual would spend more to sell the property than would be gained by its sale, there is no countable value.

**Examples:**
- Costs of initiating court action before property can be sold
- Cost of removing structures from the property

### Owner Occupied

Property owned and occupied by the individual is excluded. This exclusion ends the month after the individual moves from the home, unless they are entering a nursing facility, intermediate care facility, or assisted living facility with Waiver services.

> 📋 **Note:** Lots adjacent to the home are **not excluded** if they can be sold separately.

### Dependent Relative Occupied

Property occupied by a spouse or other dependent relative is excluded. This exclusion ends if the spouse or dependent relative moves from the home. Must be reevaluated at each renewal (477 NAC 23-003.05(B)(iii)(4)).

### Undue Hardship

If property is jointly owned and forcing a sale would cause undue hardship to the other owner, the value can be disregarded. Must be reevaluated at each renewal.

### Self-Employment

Property used in self-employment that the individual is actively engaged in as the primary means of earning a livelihood is excluded (477-000-050).

The expectation is that the client, their spouse, or financially responsible parent is doing the labor and tasks as "work activity" (See Appendix 477-000-050 for examples).

**Does NOT meet self-employment criteria:**
- Filing a self-employment tax return alone
- Making management decisions alone
- Leased/rented out land
- Land enrolled in an Agricultural Program

### Property Used for Self-Support

The first **$6,000 in equity value** of property used to support the individual is excluded (477-000-050).

### Native American Property

Certain property owned or managed on behalf of Native Americans can be excluded (477 NAC 23-003.06(B)).

---

## Income and Expenses from Property

### Life Estate Income

Income from a life estate is generally considered **unearned income** (477 NAC 22-004.01(N)):
- The life tenant is entitled to income (if any) generated from the property
- The department has no legal authority to force production of income
- The agreement in place (lease, cash rent, crop share, etc.) must be verified and documented
- Passive receipt of income from a resource does not constitute self-employment (477 NAC 22-003.03)

**If income is received periodically and the most recent payment was spent prior to eligibility:**
- May be considered unavailable and not used in the initial budget
- Set a worker alert for when the next payment is expected
- All periodic payments received after eligibility is approved are prorated monthly (477 NAC 22-004.02(A))

### Life Estate Expenses

The life tenant is responsible for maintaining property for the remainderman. If paid by the client (life tenant) and verified, the following are allowed expenses from life estate income (477 NAC 22-004.04(f)):

- Property insurance
- Property taxes
- Portions of a mortgage payment (may be excluded upon policy review)
- Maintenance
- Repair costs

> ⚠️ **Depreciation and capital improvements** on a life estate property are generally **not allowable expenses** to offset income.

A permanent alteration that substantially increases the overall life estate value is a capital improvement.

The worker must enter the net life estate unearned income in NFOCUS and document the details of each expense used. See 477-000-030 for examples.

Submit questions about mortgage payments, capital improvements, and additional expenses to **DHHS.MedicaidPolicyQuestions@Nebraska.gov**.

## Liquidation of Property

When an individual has excess resources due to ownership of real property, the individual may be eligible if an **Agreement to Sell Real Property (IM-1)** is signed.

### Key Requirements

- A separate signed form is required for each parcel causing excess resources
- If moving from home to a medical institution, up to **six months** is given to determine if the individual can return home
- If the individual is a joint owner, permission of other owners or court action may be necessary
- **The liquidation process cannot be used to exclude property in order to begin a deprivation of resources sanction period**

### Liquidation Process

1. Property cannot be excluded as a resource until the IM-1 form is signed
2. The liquidation period begins the **month after** the month the IM-1 is signed
3. Ensure the correct time period is shown on the form for proper notice
4. Only the individual, their spouse, or a legal representative can sign the IM-1 form
5. The process is only allowable if the individual or their spouse are the sole owner(s), unless there is written statement from all other owners that they are willing to sell
6. If an IM-1 cannot be completed because of multiple owners, a partition action in County Court may be required based on the client's equity interest (477 NAC 23-003.05(B)(iii)(3))

**For SIMP cases:**
- Property must be solely owned by the institutional spouse
- The process is not available if any proceeds will go to the community spouse
- The community spouse is not an applicant, so the IM-1 process is not available for them

> ⚠️ **No Retroactive Eligibility:** There is no retroactive eligibility if the client had excess resources during the retroactive period due to real property other than their home (477 NAC 23-003.05(B)(iv)). However, prospective eligibility may be determined if an IM-1 is signed.

### Process for Reviewing Ownership of Real Property

**Step 1:** Review documentation to determine ownership interest and equity value
- If information is questionable or unclear, submit a policy question to DHHS Medicaid Policy Questions
- Request additional verification if needed
- If equity value will not affect eligibility, enter resource with verified encumbrance(s) and process as normal

**Step 2:** Determine if the client has legal authority to sell the property
- If no legal authority, give **60 days** to initiate legal action to obtain authority to liquidate (477 NAC 23-003.05(B)(iv)(1))—send a 60 day VR
- If client owns home with other persons, see 477 NAC 23-003.05(B)(ii)

**Step 3:** If client has legal authority to sell, complete the top section and send the IM-1 for each applicable property
- The liquidation period field begins the month after the IM-1 is signed
- Enter the **legal description of the property** (not the street address) in the description field
- If client refuses to sign, the case must be closed due to excess resources
- If signed and returned, property is exempt for **six months** to allow for sale

**Step 4:** A transfer or sale for less than fair market value is subject to deprivation penalty unless an exception applies (477 NAC 23-003.04(K) or 477 NAC 23-003.04(L))
- See Policy Memo 23-16 for additional information
- See Policy Memo 25-01 (effective February 1, 2025) for eligibility groups no longer subject to deprivation review when requesting or receiving HCBS services
- See [AVS Procedural Guide](AVS%20Procedural%20Guide.md) for AVS Property Search functionality

### Extension of Time Limit

If the client is unable to liquidate the property in six calendar months, the supervisor may authorize an additional **three calendar months**. In determining whether to allow an extension, the supervisor shall consider:

1. If the property has been placed on the market
2. If the client is asking a fair price
3. If the asking price has been reduced
4. If the client understands the requirement for liquidation
5. If the client has not refused a reasonable offer to purchase (a reasonable offer is at least **2/3 of either the estimated current market value or the proven actual value**)
6. The economic conditions in the area and if real estate is selling

> ⚠️ **If property is not liquidated prior to the end of the exclusionary period, the individual's equity value must be added to the budget, unless an exception makes the resource unavailable.**

---

## Spousal Impoverishment and Real Property

In a spousal impoverishment case, the assessment and designation of resources forms may include real property. It is **not necessary** to include property which is not countable (see Excluded Property above).

### Important Points

**Property can lose its exclusion:**
- Property excluded on the assessment of resources which loses its exclusion must be included on the designation of resources
- Property excluded at the time of designation but later loses exclusion is countable if owned by the institutional spouse
- Property excluded at designation that later loses exclusion **does not count** toward the community spouse resource limit if owned by the community spouse

**Deprivation considerations:**
- Property transferred between spouses does not trigger deprivation provisions
- Property transferred to other parties may trigger deprivation—see [Deprivation of Resources Process Guide](Deprivation%20of%20Resources%20Process%20Guide.md)

**Assessment timing:**
- Complete the assessment for the first month that an individual met the 30 day institutionalized care criteria
- If property is transferred or sold during the first month of institutionalization, countable property held as of the day of institutionalization is included on the assessment

**Exclusions from assessment/designation:**
- Property owned by a trust must not be included on the designation of resources form
- Life estate interest must not be included on the assessment or designation
- Properties owned jointly with other individuals must not be included on the assessment, unless there is verification from other owners that they are willing to sell

> 📋 **Note:** Deprivation of Resources information was moved to the [Deprivation of Resources Process Guide](Deprivation%20of%20Resources%20Process%20Guide.md).

## Institutional Care Transitions

### Verifying Home Ownership When Client Moves to a Medical Institution

When a report or application indicates a client has moved to a medical institution:

1. Review the case to determine if home ownership is known or alleged
2. Review county assessor and/or other online records specific to the client's known addresses and counties of residence (current and previous) to determine if there are leads about potential property ownership
3. If ownership is unclear, contact the client or representative to clarify ownership and request additional documentation

**If the home is owned by the client:**

Contact the client or representative to ask if anyone else is currently living in the home, and their relationship to the client.

- Review 477 NAC 23-003.05(B)(iii)(4) to determine if there is a relative living in the home which would allow the home to remain exempt
- If there is a qualifying relative, the home remains exempt unless/until the relative moves away

**Six-Month Home Exemption:**

A client's home remains exempt for the **first six months** in a medical institution to allow time to see if they can return home (477 NAC 23-003.05(B)(iii)(5)):

- The six months begin the **month after** the month the client moved to the institution, regardless of whether the case is active or pending
- Set an **alert for the beginning of month 5** to determine ownership and equity, and initiate the liquidation process if applicable
- The exemption ends if:
  - Medical documentation shows the client will not be able to return home
  - The client or representative provides a signed statement that the client will not return
  - The home is put on the real estate market

**If the client has not returned home by the fifth month:**
- Send a VR for property ownership and equity value documentation
- When documentation is received, refer to the Process for Reviewing Ownership of Real Property for additional actions

✓ **Check All Exclusions:** Review all possible exclusion reasons before counting property as a resource

✓ **Life Estates Are Generally Unavailable:** Both life tenant and remainderman interests are typically unavailable resources

✓ **IM-1 Required for Liquidation:** The Agreement to Sell Real Property form must be signed before property can be excluded during the liquidation period

✓ **Six-Month Institutional Exemption:** Clients entering medical institutions have six months before their home is counted as a resource

✓ **Set Month 5 Alerts:** Always set an alert for month 5 of institutional care to initiate property review

✓ **Document Life Estate Expenses:** Verify and document all allowable expenses from life estate income

✓ **Review at Each Renewal:** Dependent relative occupancy and undue hardship exclusions must be reevaluated at each renewal
