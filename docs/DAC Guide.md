## Key Definitions

**Beneficiary Data Exchange (BDE)**
A file exchange from the Social Security Administration (SSA) that reports Social Security information to the State of Nebraska for individuals who have applied for or are receiving public assistance benefits.

**Childhood Disability Beneficiary (CDB)**
For SSA purposes, an individual who has been determined disabled before age 22, is the child of an individual entitled to SSA benefits, and was dependent on the entitled person. This creates the entitlement for the disabled child to receive benefits on the parent's claim. SSA also sometimes refers to these beneficiaries as Disabled Adult Children.

**Disabled Adult Child (DAC)**
Persons who have been disabled from a young age who may lose their SSI benefits solely because they begin to receive Social Security benefits due to the retirement, death, or disability of a parent.

**Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (RSDI)**
Retirement, survivors, and disability benefits paid to workers, their dependents, and survivors. RSDI is commonly referred to as Social Security or Title II.

**Share of Cost (SOC)**
A SOC is a monthly amount a beneficiary pays as part of their benefits stemming from income greater than the state's income limits for benefits.

**Social Security Administration (SSA)**
A U.S. government agency that administers social programs covering disability, Medicare, retirement, and survivors' benefits.

**Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI)**
A payroll tax-funded, federal insurance program managed by the SSA designed to provide income supplements to people who are physically restricted in their ability to be employed because of a notable disability.

**State Data Exchange (SDX)**
A file exchange from SSA that reports SSI information to the State of Nebraska for individuals who have applied for or are receiving public assistance benefits.

**Supplemental Security Income (SSI)**
A means-tested program administered by SSA for aged and disabled individuals who meet certain guidelines. This program differs from RSDI in that it is not dependent upon work history and is based on age, disability, and financial need.

## Purpose & Scope

The purpose of this guide is to provide guidance for staff when navigating cases that specifically involve DAC/CDB status and to combine all information about this subject into a single, streamlined document. The guide is separated into four sections:

- **Section 1** provides general guidance regarding the DAC or CDB income disregard and eligibility requirements
- **Section 2** provides direction regarding DAC considerations including marriage, SSI status, resources, and special populations
- **Section 3** provides workers with example and scenario situations demonstrating DAC eligibility
- **Section 4** provides direction for budgeting DAC cases in NFOCUS

## Section 1: DAC/CDB Income Disregard Requirements

### Overview

The DAC/CDB category is a special category of Medicaid eligibility created to protect Medicaid coverage for persons who have been disabled from a young age and would lose their SSI benefits solely because they begin to receive Social Security benefits due to the retirement, death, or disability of a parent.

> **Important:** This category is only available for recipients who lose SSI due to Title II (Social Security) income. If a recipient loses SSI due to Railroad Retirement or Veteran's Administration benefits, or due to their own income, resources, or Social Security benefit, they do not qualify as a DAC.

### Who Qualifies as DAC/CDB

**To qualify as a Disabled Adult Child or Childhood Disability Beneficiary, an individual must meet ALL of the following requirements:**

1. **Lost SSI after 11/10/1986** (Public Law 99-643) due to mandatory receipt/increase of Title II benefits on a parent's record due to retirement, death, or disability of a parent
2. **Age 18 years or older**
3. **Disability/Blindness onset before age 22**
4. **Would remain eligible for SSI** (including the SSI resource standard) if not receiving the Title II disabled adult child benefits

> **Reference:** DAC/CDB regulations defined at 27-002.01(C)(ii)

### When is C Claim Income Disregarded?

If the recipient meets all factors listed above, then the C claim income is not counted in determining eligibility.

**Critical Points:**
- DAC status must be confirmed at each renewal—someone previously identified as a DAC may no longer qualify due to earnings, resources, or an increase to their own Social Security income
- The total of all countable income (other than the parent's claim) should be below the current Federal Benefit Rate (FBR) for SSI
- The disregard amount must be adjusted annually with COLA to entirely disregard the income

### Which Income Should Be Disregarded?

Only the Social Security claim based upon the parent's benefit record should be disregarded in determining Medicaid eligibility.

**Steps to Identify Disregardable Income:**

1. **Review the BDE Interface record:** Under the Benefit Detail tab, locate the Claim Number box in the upper left (below name and birth date)
2. **Identify the claim type:**
   - If claim number ends with letter **C**: This is a benefit from a parent's claim (disregardable if DAC qualifies)
   - If no "C" claim from Social Security: Individual cannot be a DAC
   - Individual may have their own Social Security claim (ends in A) which is countable

3. **Apply disregard:**
   - Disregard the amount received on the C claim if the recipient meets all DAC eligibility points
   - This applies ONLY to Social Security income—VA benefits or Railroad Retirement benefits based on a parent's claim are NOT disregarded
   - Apply earned and unearned income disregards before comparing to the FBR

> **Note:** If BDE shows a combined claim amount and individual claim amounts cannot be determined, contact SSA for clarification.

### Eligibility and HHA Category

- A client in a DAC or CDB category would not be eligible for HHA because they meet another category of eligibility
- If an individual meets DAC requirements, assign the program case to position #2651004 for eligibility determination under this category

## Section 2: DAC Eligibility Considerations

### Marriage

- **DAC + DAC:** If a DAC marries another DAC, both retain DAC status and their parent's claims are disregarded
- **DAC + Non-DAC:** If a DAC marries someone who does not qualify as DAC, the DAC status is lost and all income is counted

### SSI Status

- If the recipient has never received SSI, they are not a DAC
- Receipt of SSI can be confirmed through the SDX interface
- If the interface does not populate or lacks sufficient information, contact SSA
- **Reference:** See SDX Guide for more information regarding SSI

### Resources

Resources are counted the same as for any other recipient:
- All trusts must be reviewed
- Burial resources must be verified within specified maximum
- No additional disregards apply
- **DAC resource limits:** $2,000 for individual or $3,000 for a DAC couple
- DACs with resources close to the limit should be provided information about ABLE accounts (not a countable resource for Medicaid)
- **Reference:** ABLE Act Guide and Nebraska Enable Savings Plan (administered by State Treasurer with First National Bank)

### 1619b Status

- If 1619b status is lost due to receipt of a parent's Social Security claim, review DAC eligibility as if regular SSI status is lost
- All income other than the parent's claim is totaled and compared to the FBR
- The 1619b category is only available to those eligible for SSI—Medicaid does not make 1619b eligibility determinations
- If 1619b status is lost and recipient is not eligible as DAC, review eligibility for other categories (e.g., ABD or MIWD)

### Residents of Medical Institutions

- If a recipient who loses SSI due to the parent's claim is a resident of a medical institution (nursing home, intermediate care facility), the DAC income disregard does NOT apply when calculating Share of Cost
- Share of Cost calculation: parent's claim amount minus personal needs ($75/month) and any other medical disregards
- **Reference:** Rosters of Facilities and Services

## Section 3: Example Situations

### Example 1: Basic DAC Eligibility
Client A (age 30, disabled since age 19) earns $250/month and received SSI. Now receives $1,125/month RSDI from parent's account, losing SSI eligibility. **Qualifies as DAC.** Medicaid eligibility determined by disregarding the $1,125 RSDI benefit.

### Example 2: DAC with ABLE Account
Client B (disabled since birth, lost SSI when mother retired) receives $1,425/month from mother's Social Security. Has bank account of $525 and ABLE account of $7,500. **Qualifies as DAC.** ABLE account is disregarded; remains within SSI resource limit.

### Example 3: DAC with Own Income
Client C (age 35, disabled since age 20) receives $508/month Civil Service pension plus SSI. Begins receiving $825 parental benefits, loses SSI ($1,333 total income). **Qualifies as DAC.** Disregard $825 parental benefit; Medicaid determined using $508 minus $20 general disregard (system-applied).

### Example 4: DAC Never Working
Client D (age 25, receiving only SSI since childhood) begins receiving $1,100 parental benefits, loses SSI. **Qualifies as DAC.** Medicaid determined by disregarding the $1,100 parental benefit.

### Example 5: NOT DAC - Railroad Retirement
Client E received SSI. Father retired, now receives $1,200 from father's Railroad Retirement claim (not Social Security), loses SSI. Resources: $1,500. **Does NOT qualify as DAC.** Loss of SSI due to Railroad Retirement does not create DAC status.

### Example 6: NOT DAC - Own RSDI Exceeds FBR
Client F (age 35, disabled since age 20) has $850 RSDI on her own earnings and $1,500 savings. Begins receiving $460 parental benefits ($1,310 total). **Does NOT qualify as DAC.** Never received and lost SSI due to parental claim; own RSDI exceeds FBR. Consider Medicaid with share of cost if medical need.

### Example 7: DAC After COLA Increase
Client G received both RSDI from parent's claim and small SSI amount. After COLA increase, RSDI increased enough to lose SSI eligibility. **Qualifies as DAC.** SSI ended due to RSDI COLA increase from parent's claim.

### Example 8: NOT DAC - Resources Exceed Limit
Client H (disabled since age 18, received SSI) inherited $3,000 and became entitled to $1,500/month from deceased father's Social Security. SSI ended. **Does NOT currently qualify as DAC.** Resources exceed SSI limit. May qualify if resources reduced below limit.

### Example 9: NOT DAC - Combined Income Exceeds FBR
Client I receives $700 from own SSA disability claim (minus $20 general disregard), earns $465/month ($200 after disregards), receives $1,000 from parent's benefits. Joint account: $1,700. **Does NOT qualify as DAC.** Own SSA disability plus countable earnings exceed FBR.

### Example 10: DAC - No Other Income
Client J (sister of I) has never worked. Receives $1,000/month from parent's SSA benefits. **Qualifies as DAC.** Previously received and lost SSI due to parental claim; no other income. Parent's claim disregarded; still qualifies for SSI payment.

### Example 11: DAC in Medical Institution
Client K (disabled since age 12) received SSI until mother retired, then began receiving $1,400/month from mother's Social Security. No other income; resources below SSI limit. **Qualifies as DAC.** Later receives Aged and Disabled Waiver services—retains DAC status, no Share of Cost. After declining health, relocates to nursing home—**DAC income disregard no longer applies** to Share of Cost calculation. Share of Cost: $1,400 minus $75 personal needs and applicable medical disregards.

## Section 4: NFOCUS Budgeting for DAC

### Using the Unearned Income Data Collection Task

**Step-by-step process:**

1. **Add the gross amount** of the Social Security Income from the parent's claim
2. **Enter the amount to be subtracted** from gross income in the **Adjusted Amount field**
   - This allows the adjusted amount to be counted in the Medicaid budget
   - Allows the gross income to be used in the SNAP budget
3. **Select the adjustment reason:** Choose "Disabled Adult Child"
4. **Enter verification information:**
   - Begin date
   - Verification source
5. **Important:** Change the **MESA indicator to "Process by Worker"**

> **Note:** This prevents the system from automatically recalculating during monthly MESA runs, ensuring DAC status is maintained until the worker confirms continued eligibility.

## Key Takeaways

✓ DAC status is only for those losing SSI due to Title II Social Security income from parent's claim
✓ DAC must be confirmed at each renewal—status can change due to earnings, resources, or own income increases
✓ Identify C claim benefits in BDE for disregard—A claims are always countable
✓ Total countable income (excluding C claim) must be below current FBR
✓ DAC couples can retain status if both qualify; DAC + Non-DAC = loss of status
✓ Resources must remain within SSI limits ($2,000 individual/$3,000 couple)
✓ ABLE accounts are disregarded as resources
✓ DAC status lost for residents of medical institutions only for Share of Cost calculation
✓ Always set MESA indicator to "Process by Worker" for DAC cases
✓ Verify SSI history through SDX; contact SSA if information unclear
