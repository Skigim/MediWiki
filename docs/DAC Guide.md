Definitions:
Beneficiary Data Exchange (BENDEX/BDE) – A file exchange from the Social Security
Administration (SSA) that reports Social Security information to the State of Nebraska for
individuals who have either applied for, or are receiving public assistance benefits.
Childhood Disability Beneficiary (CDB) –For SSA purposes, a Childhood Disability
Beneficiary (CDB) is an individual who has been determined disabled before age 22, is the child
of an individual entitled to SSA benefits, and was dependent on the entitled person. This creates
the entitlement for the disabled child to receive benefits on the parent’s claim. SSA also
sometimes refers to these beneficiaries as Disabled Adult Children. It is important to remember
that not everyone entitled to this benefit from SSA will meet the DAC requirements for
Medicaid.
Disabled Adult Child (DAC) - Persons who have been disabled from a young age who may lose
their SSI benefits solely because they begin to receive Social Security benefits due to the
retirement, death, or disability of a parent.
Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (RSDI) - Retirement, survivors, and
disability benefits paid to workers, their dependents, and survivors. RSDI is commonly referred
to as Social Security, or Title II.
Share of Cost (SOC) - A SOC is a monthly amount a beneficiary pays as a part of their benefits
stemming from income greater than the state’s income limits for benefits.
Social Security Administration (SSA) - A U.S. government agency that administers social
programs covering disability, Medicare, retirement, and survivors' benefits.
Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) - A payroll tax-funded, federal insurance program
from the United States government. It is managed by the SSA, and is designed to provide income
supplements to people who are physically restricted in their ability to be employed because of a
notable disability; usually a physical disability. SSDI can be supplied on either a temporary or
permanent basis, usually directly correlated to whether the person's disability is temporary, or
permanent.
State Data Exchange (SDX) - A file exchange from SSA that reports SSI information to the State of
Nebraska for individuals who have either applied for or are receiving public assistance benefits.
Supplemental Security Income (SSI) - A means-tested program administered by SSA for aged
and disabled individuals who meet certain guidelines. This program differs from RSDI in that it
is not dependent upon work history, and is based on age, disability, and financial need.

Purpose:
Purpose: The purpose of the DAC process guide is to provide guidance for staff when
navigating cases that specifically refer to DAC/CDB, and to combine all the information about
this subject into a single, streamlined document.
The guide is separated into four different sections: Section 1 provides general guidance regarding
the DAC or CDB income disregard; Section 2 provides direction regarding DAC considerations;
Section 3 provides the worker with several example/situation scenarios; Section 4 provides
direction for the budgeting of DAC.
Section 1: Unearned Income - Disabled Adult Child (DAC) or
Childhood Disability Beneficiaries (CDB) Income Disregard
What is a DAC?
The DAC/CDB category is a special category of Medicaid eligibility. In most states, Medicaid
eligibility for the Aged or Disabled is dependent upon eligibility for SSI. This category was
created in order to protect Medicaid eligibility for persons who have been disabled from a young
age who may lose their SSI benefits solely because they begin to receive Social Security benefits
due to the retirement, death, or disability of a parent. If the recipient would remain eligible for
SSI payments without considering the additional Social Security income from their parents, then
the recipient qualifies as a DAC.
• This category is only available for recipients who lose SSI due to the Title II (Social
Security retirement, survivor, or disability benefit) income. If a recipient loses SSI due to
receiving benefits from a parent’s Railroad Retirement or Veteran’s Administration
claim, or due to their own income, resources, or Social Security benefit they do not
qualify as a DAC.
• A client in a DAC or CDB category would not be eligible for HHA because they meet
another category of eligibility.
• If, after reviewing, it is determined the individual meets the requirements for DAC;
assign the program case to position #2651004. The assigned worker will determine
eligibility under this category.
Where can I find DAC requirements?
Disabled Adult Child (DAC)/Childhood Disability Beneficiaries (CDB) regulations, defined
below, can be found at 27-002.01(C)(ii).
Disabled Adult Children (DAC)/Childhood Disability Beneficiaries (CDB) are those who
meet all the following requirements:
• Lose SSI after 11/10/1986 (Public Law 99-643) due to mandatory receipt/increase of
Title II benefits on a parent's record due to retirement, death, or disability of a parent;
• Are 18 years of age, or older.
• Whose blindness or disability began before the age of 22; and

• Would continue to be eligible for SSI payments (including the SSI resource standard) if
they were not receiving the Title II disabled adult child's benefits.
When is the C claim income disregarded?
If the recipient meets all of the factors listed in 27-002.01(C)(ii), then the C claim income is not
counted in determining eligibility.
• The status of a DAC needs to be confirmed at each renewal. Someone previously
identified as a DAC may no longer qualify due to their earnings, resources, or an increase
to their own Social Security income.
• The total of all countable income, other than the parent’s claim, should be below the
current Federal Benefit Rate for an SSI payment.
• Determine if the correct amount is being disregarded. The disregard amount will need to
be adjusted with the annual COLA in order to entirely disregard the income.
Which income should be disregarded?
Only the Social Security claim based upon their parent’s benefit record should be disregarded in
determining Medicaid eligibility. To find the amount:
• Review the Bendex (BDE) interface record. Under the Benefit Detail tab, you will see a
box marked Claim Number in the upper left hand side, below the name and birth date.
• If the claim number ends with the letter C, then it is a benefit received from a parent’s
claim. If the person does not have a “C” claim from Social Security, then they cannot be
a DAC. The recipient may also have their own Social Security claim, which ends in A
and is countable.
• Disregard the amount received on the C claim, if the recipient meets all points of DAC
eligibility. This only applies to Social Security income. If a person receives VA benefits
or Railroad Retirement benefits based on a parent’s claim, that income is not
disregarded.
• Earned and unearned income disregards should be applied before comparing to the FBR.
• If the amount shown in BDE is a combined claim, and the amount of each claim cannot
be determined, a call to SSA would be needed for clarification.
Section 2: DAC Considerations
Certain considerations must be taken into account when working a case where a DAC budget
may need to be processed:
• Marriage – If a DAC marries another person who qualifies as DAC, then both are able to
keep DAC status and their parent’s claims are disregarded. If a DAC marries someone
who does not qualify as a DAC, then the status is lost and all income is counted.
• SSI Status – If the recipient has never received SSI, then they are not a DAC. Receipt of
SSI can be confirmed through the SDX interface. If the interface does not populate, or
does not have sufficient information, a call to the Social Security Administration will be
necessary. Refer to the SDX Guide for more information regarding SSI.
• Resources – Resources are counted the same as for any other recipient. All trusts must be
reviewed, the burial resources should be verified within the specified maximum, and
there are no additional disregards which apply. A DAC’s resources must remain within

the SSI limit of $2,000 for an individual or $3,000 for a DAC couple. A DAC whose
resources are close to the limit can be provided information about ABLE accounts. ABLE
accounts are not considered a countable resource for Medicaid. The Nebraska Enable
Savings Plan is administered by the State Treasurer in conjunction with First National
Bank. (ABLE Act Guide)
• 1619b Status – If 1619b status is lost due to receipt of a parent’s Social Security claim,
review DAC eligibility in the same way as if regular SSI status is lost. All income other
than the parent’s claim is totaled and compared to the FBR. The 1619b category is only
available to those eligible for SSI, and Medicaid should not make a determination for
1619b eligibility. If 1619b status is lost, and the recipient is not eligible as a DAC, then
review eligibility for other categories of coverage (for example, ABD or MIWD).
• Residents of Medical Institutions – If a recipient who loses SSI status due to the
parent’s claim is a resident of a medical institution (Nursing Home, Intermediate Care
Facility), then the DAC income disregard does not apply when calculating their Share of
Cost amount. See example 11 in Section 3: Example Situations. Rosters of Facilities and
Services.
Section 3: Example Situations
Example 1
Client A is 30-years-old and has been disabled since the age of 19. Her income consists of
earnings of $250 per month (average) and SSI. She then begins collecting RSDI of $1125 from
her parent’s account. The new income makes her ineligible for SSI. Client A meets DAC
eligibility. She lost SSI eligibility because of the receipt of her parent’s Social Security. Her
Medicaid eligibility would be determined by disregarding the $1125 RSDI benefit from her
parent’s account.
Example 2:
Client B has been disabled since birth. She received SSI until her mother retired last year, when
she began to receive $1425 per month from her mother’s Social Security Claim. Client B has a
bank account with a balance of $525 and an ABLE account with $7500. Because an ABLE
account is disregarded as a resource, she remains within the SSI resource limit. Client B is
eligible as a DAC.
Example 3:
Client C is 35 years old and is receiving Medicaid. She has been disabled since the age of 20.
Her income consists of $508 in a Civil Service pension based on her own earnings. She also
receives SSI. She begins to receive parental benefits of $825, which increases her income to
$1,333. Client C no longer receives SSI, because of the receipt of parental benefits. Client C
meets DAC eligibility. We would disregard the parental benefit amount of $825. Medicaid
eligibility is determined using the original amount of $508 - $20 general disregard (automatically
applied by the system) in the budget.
Example 4:
Client D is 25 years old and has been receiving only SSI since childhood. He begins receiving
parental benefits of $1100. Client D no longer receives SSI, because of the receipt of parental

benefits. Client D meets the requirements for DAC eligibility. Medicaid eligibility is determined
by disregarding the parental benefit of $1100.
Example 5:
Client E has been receiving SSI. Recently, his father retired, so Client E has begun to receive
$1200 on his father’s Railroad Retirement claim, causing him to lose SSI benefits. Client E’s
resources are $1500. Client E does not qualify as a DAC. The benefit that Mr. E receives,
although based on his father’s retirement income, is not Social Security income. Loss of SSI due
to receipt of Railroad Retirement income does not qualify a person as a DAC.
Example 6:
Client F is 35 years old and is receiving Medicaid. She has been disabled since the age of 20. Her
income consists of $850 RSDI based on her own earnings. Client F has a credit union savings
account with a balance of $1500. She begins to receive parental benefits of $460, which
increases her income to $1310. Client F does not meet DAC eligibility for multiple reasons.
First, she did not receive SSI and lose it due to the receipt of a parental claim, and also her own
RSDI (A claim) is in excess of the SSI FBR. If there is a medical need, Medicaid with a share of
cost should be considered.
Example 7:
Client G has been receiving both RSDI benefits from her parent’s claim and a small amount of
SSI for several years. After this year’s most recent COLA increase, the RSDI amount increased
by enough that G is no longer eligible for SSI. G would qualify as a DAC since SSI ended due to
the RSDI COLA increase.
Example 8:
Client H has been disabled since age 18, and has received SSI for his adult life. After Client H’s
father passed away, he received a small inheritance of $3,000 and became entitled to $1,500 per
month from his father’s Social Security claim. His SSI benefits have now ended. Client H does
not qualify as a DAC at this time. His resources, including the inheritance, are above the SSI
resource limit. If his resources are reduced below the SSI limit, then he may qualify as a DAC.
Example 9:
Client I receives $700 - $20 general disregard (automatically applied by the system) per month
from his own SSA disability claim. I has also been able to maintain employment and earns $465
per month (average), which is $200 per month after income disregards are applied. I also
receives $1000 per month from his parent’s benefits. I has a joint account with his sister with a
balance of $1700 and does not qualify as a DAC because his own SSA disability income plus his
countable earnings are greater than the FBR.
Example 10:
J is the sister of I. J has never been able to work due to her disability. As with, I, J receives $1000
per month from her parent’s SSA benefits. J does qualify as a DAC because she previously
received and lost SSI due to the parental claim and has no other income. If her parent’s claim is
disregarded, she would still qualify for an SSI payment.

Example 11:
K has been disabled since age 12. K received SSI until her mother retired, at which time she
began to receive $1400 per month from her mother’s Social Security Retirement claim. Because
K has no other source of income, and her resources are below the SSI limit, she qualifies as a
DAC. After several years, K’s health began to decline, and she needed services under the Aged
and Disabled Waiver. While receiving Waiver services, her DAC status is retained, and she has
no Share of Cost. Recently, K’s health has declined further, and it was necessary for her to
relocate to a nursing home. Now that K is a resident of a medical institution, her DAC income
disregard is no longer applied to her Share of Cost calculation. Her Share of Cost would be the
amount received from her mother’s claim minus her personal needs ($75/month) and any other
medical disregards which would apply (medical insurance premium, medical costs not covered
by Medicaid, other medically necessary incurred expenses).
Section 4: N-FOCUS Budgeting of Disabled Adult Children
Using the Unearned Income Data Collection task:
1. Add the gross amount of the Social Security Income.
2. Enter the amount to be subtracted from the gross income in the Adjusted Amount field.
This will allow the adjusted amount to be counted in the Medicaid budget, and the gross
income to be used in the SNAP budget.
3. Select the Disabled Adult Child adjustment reason.
4. Enter begin date and verification source.
