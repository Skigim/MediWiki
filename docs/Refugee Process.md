# Refugee Process

**Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services | Medicaid & Long-Term Care**

## Overview

Applicants and clients who are considered refugees may be eligible for the EA Refugee Resettlement Program (RRP) and EA Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA) if found to be categorically ineligible for other assistance, such as Medicaid. It is important that these clients are identified and screened for Medicaid eligibility prior to any referrals to EA for RRP/RMA. This guide helps field staff identify and refer these cases for MLTC processing.

## Key Definitions

**Refugee:** An individual who has fled their home country and cannot return due to a well-founded fear of persecution. Refugees are admitted to the United States under Section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

**Refugee Resettlement Program (RRP):** A program managed by Economic Assistance (EA) providing cash and support services to refugees who are categorically ineligible for other assistance programs.

**Refugee Medical Assistance (RMA):** A medical assistance program managed by Economic Assistance providing coverage to refugees who are categorically ineligible for Medicaid and are within their first 12 months (or 4 months for certain entry dates) in the U.S.

**Adjusted Status:** An individual whose immigration status has changed from refugee to another status, such as lawful permanent resident. These individuals may still qualify for refugee benefits if they meet timeframe requirements.

**VLP:** Verify Lawful Presence - the electronic system used to verify immigration status through the Department of Homeland Security.

## Referral Process

### Pre-Referral Review

**All points above must be reviewed prior to making a referral** to the position number.

**If unable to determine a client's refugee status:**
- Workers should consult with their supervisor to determine if an assignment should be made

### Application Management Referrals

**Referrals received by Application Management** that are determined to potentially be Refugee applicants for Medicaid (MLTC 53 or 64) will be:
1. Pended
2. Assigned to the **Refugee Medicaid Referral position number (87055714)**

### Field Worker Referrals

**Workers in the field who identify a PENDING or ACTIVE Medicaid case** that appears to be a potential Refugee case should:
1. Assign it to the **Refugee Medicaid Referral position number (87055714)**
2. **All alerts should be left** for the assigned worker
3. **Work tasks (WTs) can be cleared**
4. **Narrate the referral** to the position number and the reason for the referral

**Narration Example:**
