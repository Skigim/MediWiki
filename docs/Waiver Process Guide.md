# Waiver Process Guide
*Comprehensive Procedures for Home and Community-Based Waiver Services Management*

## Overview

This comprehensive guide outlines the complete process for managing Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) waiver cases in N-FOCUS, including waiver requests, program case opening and closing, renewals, and special procedures for spousal impoverishment. Waiver programs work in conjunction with Medicaid to promote independence by offering services, skills, and equipment which allow individuals to receive comprehensive long-term care in settings such as their home or assisted living facility.

Waiver was designed as a cost-effective alternative to institutional care and promotes independence in the community. Each waiver program (AD, CDD, TBI, DDAD, FSW) has its own eligibility criteria and offers a variety of benefits. This guide provides detailed procedures for Medicaid staff working with waiver-eligible individuals to ensure proper case management, budget processing, and coordination with Service Coordinators and the E&E Unit.

**Scope:** Applies to all HCBS waiver programs including AD, CDD, TBI, DDAD, and FSW

## Section 1: Waiver Request Process

### 1.1 Prerequisites for Waiver Services

**Prior to receiving waiver services, an individual must be eligible for Medicaid** (with or without SOC).

**In addition, the individual must meet ONE of the following:**

1. Age 65 or over, OR
2. Have a disability determination (SSA or SRT), OR
3. Have a diagnosis of traumatic brain injury

### 1.2 Exceptions to Medicaid Eligibility Requirement

**Waiver assessment may proceed without Medicaid eligibility when:**

1. **Assessment needed to determine level of care for deprivation penalty:**
   - Referral email should specifically state this purpose
   - LOC determination establishes when lookback period begins

2. **Request for spousal impoverishment (SIMP) received:**
   - Referral email should specifically state this purpose
   - SIMP assessment may be completed before Medicaid approval

### 1.3 Special Considerations for QI-1 and SLMB

**Individuals in QI-1 or SLMB budget must be assessed for eligibility in SOC/MN budget.**

- Cannot activate waiver while in QI-1 or SLMB category
- Must move to MN/SOC budget to receive waiver services
- Worker processes category change per procedures in Section 2.4b

### 1.4 Waiver Activation Requirements

**Waiver cannot be activated until ALL waiver criteria are met.**

**The Medicaid SSW must NOT pend or activate a waiver program case until requested to do so by the SC.**

### 1.5 Making Waiver Referrals

Medicaid staff can make referrals for waiver to: **DHHS.HCBSWaiverapp@nebraska.gov**

**Upon receipt of referral, E&E unit will:**
- Schedule meeting with Medicaid beneficiary (or Authorized Representative/POA/Guardian)
- Conduct level of care assessment
- May request DD-10 form as part of process

**Note:** DD-10 form is part of waiver process but is NOT a Medicaid eligibility requirement.

**If DD-10 or additional waiver documents received by Medicaid staff:**
- Forward information to DHHS.HCBSWaiverapp@nebraska.gov

### 1.6 Deprivation Review Requirement

**When individual meets waiver eligibility, review the 60-month lookback period.**

**If individual HAS deprivation of resources:**
- No waiver eligibility until period of ineligibility satisfied
- No Medicaid eligibility for ANY programs (including SLMB, QI-1, etc.)
- Waiver will NOT be activated until deprivation review completed and no period of ineligibility determined

**If individual does NOT have deprivation of resources:**
- Proceed with waiver approval process

**Required Tool:**
Worker must use the **Deprivation of Resources Process Guide** while reviewing the 60-month lookback period.

### 1.7 Personal Assistance Services (PAS)

**If personal assistance services (PAS) requested on application:**
- Refer to PAS Process Guide / PAS Worker Guide
- Follow PAS-specific procedures

---

## Section 2: Opening a Waiver Program Case

### 2.1 Responsibility for Opening Waiver

**It is the responsibility of MLTC staff to run Medicaid budgets in order to activate waiver.**

Each waiver participant is activated in their own waiver program case.

**Special budgeting procedures for spouses:** See 477 NAC 24-001.02

### 2.2 Case Assignment Considerations

Certain Medicaid cases are assigned (see Medicaid Position Numbers for Case Assignments document).

**In instance of assigned Medicaid case, assigned Medicaid worker will:**
1. Review for 60-month lookback period
2. Open waiver program case after deprivation review complete
3. Set LTC indicator in case as applicable

### 2.3 Waiver Effective Date

**When pending a waiver case, it will be effective for the month the individual was approved for waiver.**

**Critical Rule:** The waiver begin date cannot be prior to the Medicaid eligibility date in N-FOCUS.

**However:** The waiver program case may need to be added for the current or previous month, as requested by the SC.

**Example:**
> An application for Medicaid is received on 5/1/2023 requesting waiver and the individual was approved for Medicaid effective 5/1/2023. On 8/1/2023 the worker reviews a change report submitted by the Office on Aging stating the individual was approved for waiver services effective 7/13/2023. The AD program case would be pended in the mainframe or the expert system of N-FOCUS for 7/1/2023. The case will need to be checked out, and Medicaid budgets run from 7/2023 through 9/2023 to activate the AD program case.

### 2.4 Steps to Add or Reopen Waiver Program Case

**Step 1:** Check out the case to the expert system

**Step 2:** Double click on case actions for the month waiver was approved
- If change report does not indicate begin date, contact SC for the date

**Step 3:** Select add (or reopen) and add the appropriate waiver program case for the participant
- The begin date is the date provided by SC (or the reopen date)

**Step 4:** Update living arrangement if required
- If living arrangement requires update to assisted living with waiver (AL/W), make change for next month
- Follow notice requirements if there is adverse action
- This ensures when budget is processed to activate waiver, there will not be adverse action in current (and previous, if applicable) month

**Step 5:** Activate the waiver by processing Medicaid budgets
- Process budgets beginning with month of waiver approval through the come up month

#### 2.4a If Participant Not Eligible for ABD/Med or MIWD

If budget goes into SOC, the Medically Needy (MN) budget should be set to **ACTIVE** for waiver-eligible individual.

**Important:** The SOC is obligated to be paid to the provider for services.

**Note:** Waiver eligibility will not appear in the budget summary. When case is checked in, waiver program case will show as "active" on N-FOCUS mainframe.

#### 2.4b If Participant in SLMB or QI-1 Budget

Worker must take following actions to move case to MN/SOC:

1. On Medicaid Participants pop-up screen during budgeting, select MN
2. Authorize the budget
3. On Spenddown screen, select ACTIVE

**See 477 NAC 27-004.04 through 004.04(D)** for additional information on special considerations when moving budget from QI-1 to SOC.

### 2.5 Final Steps

**Step 6:** After checking case in, assign waiver program case to SC and add narrative

**Step 7:** Resources must be reviewed in 60-month lookback period (if not previously completed)
- Medicaid case may need to be assigned to applicable position number (see Medicaid Position Numbers for Case Assignments)
- Deprivation review must be done prior to activating waiver case

---

## Section 3: Closing the Waiver Program Case

### 3.1 Request from Service Coordinator

If a request is received from the SC to close the waiver case, action must be taken by the Medicaid worker.

**To close a waiver program case:**

**Step 1:** Check out the case to the expert system

**Step 2:** Double click on case actions for the month waiver was requested to close
- Closure date should be last day of month requested by SC, providing for 10-day notice
- A closure reason will need to be selected

**Step 3:** Update the living arrangement as applicable

**Step 4:** Process the SOC or living arrangement change in Medicaid budget, allowing for adequate and timely notice

**Step 5:** When case is checked in
- Waiver case will no longer show as active in mainframe
- Action taken on case will generate alert for assigned SC
- SC will send notices for waiver

### 3.2 Medicaid Case Closure

**If the Medicaid case is closed, this action will also close the waiver program case.**

**Reason:** If an individual loses Medicaid eligibility, they no longer meet waiver eligibility.

**Notice Requirements:**

A notice of action must be sent. The notice must include:
- Medicaid closure reason and effective date
- Any applicable policy references
- Indication that waiver services have also closed

**This action will also generate an alert for the assigned SC.** The SC will send specific notices for waiver.

---

## Section 4: Reopening from Closed Status

### 4.1 When Reopening is Needed

After waiver has been activated, any action taken to close Medicaid program case will also close the waiver program case. Therefore, reopening a Medicaid case that was recently closed may require worker to also reopen the waiver case.

**When reopening, use the prior waiver case (reopen) rather than creating a new waiver program case for the individual.**

### 4.2 Determine if Waiver Was in Closed Status

**Step 1:** Review waiver closure date and determine if Medicaid eligibility actions closed the waiver

#### 4.2a For AD Waiver Cases

If AD waiver case was in closed status, **new referral to AD Waiver and LOC assessment are required.**

**Example 1 - New Referral Required:**
> Action taken on 5/16/23 to close Medicaid effective 6/1/23 for renewal not completed. On 6/3/23 the individual completes the renewal, and Medicaid is reopened effective 6/1/23. Since the AD Waiver case was in closed status effective 6/1/23, a new referral and assessment are required before the AD Waiver case is reopened.

**Example 2 - No Referral Required:**
> Action taken on 5/16/23 to close Medicaid 6/1/23 for renewal not completed. On 5/26/23 the individual completes the renewal, and Medicaid is reopened effective 6/1/23. Since the AD Waiver cases never went into a closed status, no referral or assessment are needed. Proceed to step 2 unless it is documented the SC requested waiver be closed.

#### 4.2b For Other Waiver Types

For all other waiver types (CDD, DDAD, or FSW), **contact the Services Coordinator** to determine if waiver case should be reopened or remain closed.

### 4.3 Reopening Process

If waiver was closed for a Medicaid reason (such as renewal not completed), the Medicaid program case must be reopened prior to reopening the waiver program case.

**Process:**

1. See "Opening a Waiver Program Case" (Section 2) for detailed steps on reactivating the waiver
2. This action will generate an alert for the assigned SC
3. The waiver program case may need to be reassigned to SC after checking the case in

---

## Section 5: Renewal and Change Management

### 5.1 Ongoing Eligibility Requirement

**The individual must remain eligible for ABD, MIWD, or MN/SOC to remain eligible for waiver.**

### 5.2 Renewal Form Not Received

**If a renewal form/verifications have not been received from individual and it is due:**

**Step 1:** Attempt to contact the individual, SC, POA or authorized representative
- Remind them to submit renewal/verifications
- Contact methods: phone, paper, or online

**Step 2:** If renewal form/verifications have not been received
- Case will be closed allowing for 10-day notice

### 5.3 Change in Medicaid Category

**Considerations for change in Medicaid category:**

**Step 1:** The Medicaid worker should attempt to contact individual, SC, POA or authorized representative with outcome of renewal/change
- Contact when there is new Medicaid category or SOC amount that will impact waiver services
- This ensures both individual and SC aware of impact for current service providers
- **Complete this step PRIOR to sending Notice of Action (NOA)**
- **Complete this step PRIOR to authorizing budget/making Medicaid category change**

**Important:** Waiver is considered an institutional level of care living arrangement and will follow existing MLTC renewal processes.

### 5.4 Move to LTC Facility

**If an In-Home waiver individual moves into a LTC facility:**

**Step 1:** Worker will assign Medicaid case to position number 42651130 (Position Number Assignments)

**Step 2:** Assigned worker will:
1. Update budget for next possible month taking into account adverse action
2. Review for 60-month lookback period, as necessary
   - This may only pertain to new instances being made aware of that appear to be deprivation
   - It likely will not be the first deprivation review

### 5.5 Abuse, Neglect, or Exploitation Concerns

**If worker becomes aware of concerns regarding abuse, neglect, or financial exploitation:**
- Make a referral to Adult Protective Services (APS)

**A referral may also be needed when:**
- Individual is no longer able to manage their own affairs (self-neglect)

### 5.6 Renewal Date Alignment

**NOTE:** The date for a Medicaid annual renewal and the date of the waiver renewal may not always align.

### 5.7 Personal Assistance Services

**If personal assistance services (PAS) requested on application:**
- Refer to PAS Process Guide / PAS Worker Guide

---

## Section 6: Spousal Impoverishment (SIMP) for Waiver

### 6.1 SIMP Assessment Request

Either spouse may request a SIMP assessment of resources.

**SIMP assessment is completed for:**
- First month that a spouse is institutionalized, OR
- When it's been verified they likely require thirty (30) days of institutionalized level of care

**See:** SIMP 30 Day Criteria Guide

### 6.2 Case Assignment for SIMP

**If SIMP is requested while Medicaid is active, pending, or in SOC status:**
- Assign case to position number 42651130

**For cases that are not active or pending:**
- Follow Position Number Assignments document
