# SIMP Budgeting Q & A
*Spousal Impoverishment Budgeting Questions and Answers*

## Overview

This comprehensive Q&A guide addresses frequently asked questions about Spousal Impoverishment (SIMP) budgeting when one spouse requires long-term care services. The guide clarifies complex scenarios involving interspousal resource transfers, IM-73 and IM-74 completion, community spouse eligibility determinations, and the interaction between SIMP provisions and both MAGI and Non-MAGI Medicaid categories.

SIMP provisions protect the community spouse's resources and income when one spouse requires institutional or waiver services. This document addresses budgeting questions that arise when the community spouse applies for their own Medicaid coverage, when both spouses receive institutional services, resource designation procedures, and master case/program case setup in N-FOCUS. Staff should reference this guide when processing cases involving spousal impoverishment provisions combined with other eligibility scenarios.

**Document Date:** Updated September 2025  
**Scope:** Applies to all Medicaid cases where one or both spouses are receiving or requesting long-term care services

## Purpose & Context

**Purpose of Q&A:**
To provide staff with clear answers to complex SIMP budgeting questions, ensuring accurate eligibility determinations when spousal impoverishment provisions intersect with other Medicaid categories, resource transfers, and case setup scenarios.

**Regulatory Foundation:**
- 444 NAC 26-003.02(D): Interspousal transfers provisions
- SIMP resource and income allocation rules
- MAGI and Non-MAGI eligibility standards

**Policy Consultation:**
Many SIMP questions involve unique fact patterns. When in doubt, submit policy question with case-specific details for official guidance.

## Section 1: Interspousal Transfers and Initial Eligibility

### Q1: Does initial eligibility for SIMP require interspousal transfers be completed/verified prior to approval?

**Answer:**

No. The IM-74 may be completed, and Medicaid eligibility determined before all resources have changed ownership.

**Process Timeline:**

**At Initial Approval:**
- IM-74 may be completed
- Medicaid eligibility may be determined
- Resources do not need to have changed ownership yet to reflect the arrangement on the IM-74 form

**At First Renewal:**
The ownership of all resources is verified again at the time of the institutionalized spouse's first Medicaid renewal.

**Renewal Verification Requirement:**

**If necessary transfers NOT completed at first renewal:**
- AND the institutionalized spouse retains ownership in more than $4,000 in resources
- THEN Medicaid must be closed due to excess resources

**Exception to Deprivation Provisions:**

Transfer of resources between spouses is an **exception to the deprivation of resource provisions** UNLESS:

The resources transferred from the institutionalized spouse would result in the community spouse having countable resources **above the reserved amount**.

**Important Deprivation Rule:**

The amount transferred in excess of the community spouse's reserved amount is counted as a **deprivation of resources**.

**Regulatory Reference:** 444 NAC 26-003.02(D) INTERSPOUSAL TRANSFERS

**Practical Application:**

1. **At Application:**
   - Complete IM-73 and IM-74
   - Approve Medicaid if institutionalized spouse has under $4,000
   - Resource transfers may still be in progress

2. **Before First Renewal:**
   - Inform couple that transfers must be completed by renewal
   - Explain that failure to transfer will result in closure if over $4,000

3. **At First Renewal:**
   - Verify actual ownership of all resources
   - If institutionalized spouse has over $4,000: Close for excess resources
   - If transfers completed properly: Continue coverage

4. **Monitor for Excess Transfer:**
   - Ensure community spouse does not receive more than reserved amount
   - Any amount over reserved amount = deprivation penalty for institutionalized spouse

## Section 2: SIMP Status Changes and Special Categories

### Q2: How is the case budgeted when the community spouse begins to receive institutional services?

**Answer:**

If the community spouse begins to receive institutional services, then the eligibility for SIMP ends and the designation of resources does not apply.

**Why SIMP Ends:**

SIMP provisions exist to protect the community spouse when ONE spouse needs institutional care. When BOTH spouses need institutional care:
- SIMP protections no longer apply
- Each spouse budgeted separately (see Long-Term Care Q&A Question 2)
- Resource designation from IM-74 no longer controls
- Each spouse gets individual resource standard

**Budgeting Requirements When Both Need Institutional Care:**

1. Each spouse budgeted in separate program case (may need separate master cases)
2. Each spouse gets $2,000 (or current standard) resource limit
3. Resources in each spouse's name counted for that spouse only
4. Income allocated separately
5. Each spouse's SOC calculated independently

**Transition Process:**

- Close SIMP case
- Open new institutional case(s) per standard LTC procedures
- IM-74 designation no longer applies
- Each spouse owns whatever resources are in their name

### Q3: Are medical insurance disregards allowed in SIMP cases?

**Answer:**

Yes, a spouse and participant's medical insurance premium are allowed disregards in SIMP cases as they are in other Non-MAGI Medicaid categories.

**Allowed Disregards:**

✓ **Institutionalized spouse's medical insurance premium**  
✓ **Community spouse's medical insurance premium**

**NOT Allowed Disregards:**

✗ **Dependent relative's health insurance premiums** are NOT allowed disregards

**Important Distinction:**

- SIMP cases follow Non-MAGI disregard rules
- Only the spouses' own premiums count
- Premiums for children, other relatives do not disregard
- Premium must be for medical insurance (not other insurance types)

**Application:**

Enter medical insurance premiums as income disregards same as other Non-MAGI cases. Document whose premium it is and verify amount.

### Q4: Can an individual in SIMP also be eligible for MIWD?

**Answer:**

Having an individual eligible for both SIMP and MIWD would likely be a rare situation. N-FOCUS is not set up to simultaneously run both categories of Medicaid.

**Process for Rare Dual Eligibility:**

Staff must work with **Policy and Production Support** to accurately process the Medicaid benefit.

**Why This is Complex:**

1. **SIMP** = Spousal impoverishment with LTC services
2. **MIWD** = Medicaid for employed disabled individuals
3. **System Limitation:** N-FOCUS cannot run both simultaneously
4. **Manual Workaround Required:** Production Support assistance needed

**When to Contact Policy and Production Support:**

- Individual meets MIWD criteria (employed, disabled, income/resources within limits)
- AND individual has spouse and SIMP provisions should apply
- AND individual receiving or requesting LTC services

**Documentation:**

Clearly document:
- Individual's work activity and MIWD eligibility factors
- Spouse status and SIMP applicability
- LTC service type
- Request for Policy and Production Support guidance

## Section 3: IM-73 Reassessment and AVS Requirements

### Q5: Are there situations where the agency may have to redo the IM-73?

**Answer:**

In general, the IM-73 is a document that is completed once. However, there are exceptional circumstances.

**General Rule:**

IM-73 is completed once at the beginning of SIMP case and sets the community spouse reserved amount permanently.

**Exception - When Redo May Be Allowed:**

If there were instances such as:
- The agency failed to include information, OR
- Used incorrect data that would make a difference in the reserved amount

**Required Process for Redo Request:**

**A policy question must be sent asking if the IM-73 can be redone.**

**What to Include in Policy Question:**
- Case specific details
- What information was missing or incorrect
- How it would change the reserved amount
- When error was discovered
- Any other relevant circumstances

**Important Notes:**

- Not all errors justify IM-73 redo
- Policy will determine if redo is appropriate
- Do not redo IM-73 without policy approval
- Minor administrative errors may not warrant redo
- Significant calculation errors more likely to be approved

**Examples of Possible Redo Situations:**

**Might Be Approved:**
- Major resource omitted from snapshot
- Incorrect snapshot date used
- Mathematical error in reserved amount calculation

**Unlikely to Be Approved:**
- Minor valuation differences
- Later discovery of small account
- Community spouse wants higher reserved amount without error

### Q6: Is utilizing the Asset Verification System (AVS) a requirement when completing the IM-73 and IM-74?

**Answer:**

AVS is part of the Medicaid Verification Plan, but its use depends on whether there is a valid application on file.

**With Valid Medicaid Application:**

**AVS IS required** when there is a valid Medicaid application on file that provides permission to use AVS.

**SIMP Assessment Without Application:**

If there was a request for a SIMP assessment and no application was received:
- Paper documentation must be utilized
- Cannot use AVS without application/consent

**Expedited AVS Process:**

The **Expedited AVS Process Reasons** are still valid for SIMP cases.

Situations where AVS may be expedited or paper documentation used:
- Emergency situations
- Immediate service needs
- Other expedited circumstances per AVS procedures

**Documentation Requirement:**

**If AVS is not used, staff must clearly narrate why paper documentation was necessary.**

**Narration Should Include:**
- Why AVS was not used
- Whether application was not on file
- Whether expedited process reason applies
- What paper documentation was obtained
- How resources were verified

**Best Practice:**

1. Obtain Medicaid application before completing IM-73/IM-74 when possible
2. Use AVS per standard verification procedures when application on file
3. Document thoroughly when paper verification used instead
4. Ensure all resources verified regardless of method

## Section 4: Community Spouse Non-MAGI Application

### Q7: When there is a spouse in the facility (SIMP spouse) and the community spouse is applying for Non-MAGI, should both spouses be budgeted in the same master case? Or a separate master case?

**Answer:**

Eligibility is determined separately for each spouse. Master case setup varies depending on situation.

**General Principle:**

Consider the income and resources of each spouse, in their own name.

**Current Guidance:**

There is not a large enough sample size of participants at this point to determine when there should be separate master cases.

**Options:**

**Option 1: Same Master Case**
- If the couple can remain in the same master case
- They must be budgeted in **separate program cases**
- Staff may need to work with Production Support

**Option 2: Separate Master Cases**
- In some cases, the couple may need to be put into separate master cases
- If both spouses are eligible for a Medicaid category, and opened in their own master case
- List the spouse not in the master case as "Out of Household"

**Special Case - In-Home Waiver:**

When determining eligibility for an in-home waiver case:
- Both the community spouse and the facility spouse would remain in the **same master case**
- But in **separate Medicaid programs**
- For instructions on the workaround, please contact **Production and Support**

**Recommendation:**

Consult with Production Support for case-specific guidance on master case setup.

### Q8: What is the appropriate resource limit for the community spouse who is applying for Medicaid?

**Answer:**

For medical coverage, the general MAGI and Non-MAGI rules apply to the community spouse, unit size of one.

**Non-MAGI Categories:**

**Aged, Blind or Disabled:**
- Must have resources under **$4,000**
- Unit size of one (individual standard)

**SLMB and QI-1 (Medicare Savings Programs):**
- **MSP resource limit applies** (varies by program)
- QI-1: $9,430 (2025)
- SLMB: $9,430 (2025)
- Check current year limits

**MAGI Categories:**

A community spouse may also be reviewed for MAGI categories if eligibility factors are met.
- **There is no resource test for MAGI**

**Important:** Community spouse resource limit is based on **their** eligibility category, not the SIMP spouse's category.

### Q9: Since both the community spouse and spouse in the facility are now applying for Medicaid (after the SIMP assessment has been completed), do the resources get combined and apply to both spouses?

**Answer:**

It depends on whether the SIMP spouse is in a facility or receiving in-home waiver.

**If SIMP Spouse Resides in Facility:**

Count the resources attributed to the community spouse **only** in determining the eligibility of the community spouse.

**If SIMP Spouse is Receiving In-Home Waiver:**

The **combined resources** of the couple is used to determine eligibility for the community spouse.

**For SIMP Spouse Eligibility:**

Only resources attributed to the SIMP spouse will be used in determining SIMP eligibility (regardless of facility vs. waiver).

**Summary Table:**

| SIMP Spouse Location | Community Spouse Resources Counted | SIMP Spouse Resources Counted |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| In Facility | CS resources only | SIMP resources only |
| In-Home Waiver | Combined couple resources | SIMP resources only |

**IM-74 Attribution:**

Use the IM-74 to determine which resources are attributed to which spouse.

### Q10: How do we handle any designated resources from the IM-74 for the community spouse?

**Answer:**

Resources owned by the community spouse are used in determining their eligibility only. The completed IM-74 form would have no effect because it only applies to the SIMP spouse.

**Why IM-74 Doesn't Control Community Spouse Eligibility:**

- IM-74 designates resources for SIMP purposes (protecting SIMP spouse eligibility)
- When community spouse applies for own Medicaid, actual ownership determines countability
- IM-74 designation is irrelevant to community spouse's own eligibility

**However - IM-74 as a Lead:**

The IM-74 would be a lead for determining the amount of countable resources.

**Use IM-74 to:**
- Identify what resources exist
- Understand current ownership
- Verify resource values
- Determine what needs additional verification

**Actual Ownership Controls:**

For community spouse eligibility determination:
- Verify actual legal ownership
- Count resources actually owned by community spouse
- Apply appropriate resource limit for their category
- IM-74 is informational but doesn't override actual ownership

### Q11: Should income from both spouses be included in the budget when determining eligibility for the community spouse?

**Answer:**

It depends on whether the SIMP spouse is in a facility or receiving in-home waiver.

**For Non-MAGI Eligibility:**

**If SIMP Spouse Resides in Facility:**
- Count any income **allocated** from the SIMP spouse as unearned income for the community spouse
- Community spouse's own income counted
- Only allocated portion of SIMP spouse income counted

**If SIMP Spouse is Receiving In-Home Waiver:**
- The income of **both spouses** is used to determine eligibility for the community spouse
- Combined household income approach

**Why the Difference:**

- Facility: Spouses living apart, only allocation counted
- In-home waiver: Spouses living together, both incomes count

**Allocation Amount:**

If facility: Allocation amount comes from SIMP calculation on IM-73 (Community Spouse Monthly Income Allowance).

### Q12: Will the community spouse receiving Medicaid impact the SOC for the spouse in the facility?

**Answer:**

The community spouse becoming eligible for Medicaid would not impact the SOC amount of the SIMP spouse unless there was a change in the income allocation.

**General Rule:**

Community spouse's Medicaid eligibility is separate from SIMP spouse's SOC calculation.

**Exception:**

**If income allocation changes:**
- Change in community spouse's income may affect how much must be allocated
- Change in allocation affects SIMP spouse's countable income
- Change in countable income affects SOC amount

**Examples of No Impact:**

- Community spouse approved for MAGI (no income allocation change)
- Community spouse approved for SSI (income already at maximum)
- Community spouse approved for MSP (no change to SIMP allocation)

**Example of Impact:**

- Community spouse was receiving $2,000/month allocation
- Community spouse begins receiving $1,800/month Social Security
- Allocation may need to be recalculated
- SIMP spouse's SOC would change if allocation changes

## Section 5: Community Spouse MAGI Application

### Q13: When there is a spouse in the facility and the community spouse is applying under MAGI, should both spouses be budgeted in the same master case? Or a separate master case?

**Answer:**

In some cases, the couple may need to be separated into separate master cases.

**Current Guidance:**

There is not a large enough sample size of participants at this point to determine when we should separate them.

**Process:**

Staff may need to work with **Production Support** for case-specific guidance.

**Factors to Consider:**

- MAGI vs. Non-MAGI system differences
- Tax filing status
- Whether in-home or facility placement
- N-FOCUS system limitations

**Recommendation:**

Contact Production Support with specific case details for master case setup guidance.

### Q14: Should both spouses be budgeted in one program case or two?

**Answer:**

If the couple can remain in the same master case they must be budgeted in **separate program cases**.

**Why Separate Program Cases:**

- Different eligibility categories (MAGI vs. SIMP)
- Different budget types
- Different income counting rules
- Different resource rules

**Setup:**

- Same master case (if possible)
- Two separate program cases
- Each spouse's eligibility determined separately

### Q15: If the tax household is listed as married filing jointly how is the income counted for the community spouse?

**Answer:**

For the community spouse, income is counted per MAGI guidelines. Tax filer rules will determine how income is counted.

**Married Filing Jointly:**

If tax household is married filing jointly:
- Follow MAGI tax filer rules
- Both spouses' income may be counted in household income
- Standard MAGI household composition rules apply

**NOT Filing Joint Return:**

If the spouses are living together and not filing a joint return:
- Medicaid eligibility would still consider both incomes
- MAGI household rules still apply even if not filing jointly

**MAGI Rules Control:**

Community spouse MAGI case follows standard MAGI income counting methodology, not SIMP income allocation rules.

### Q16: Will income from both spouses be included in the budget when determining eligibility for the community spouse?

**Answer:**

For the community spouse, Tax filer rules will determine how income is counted.

**Follow MAGI Methodology:**

- Review tax filing status
- Determine tax household composition
- Count income per MAGI tax filer rules
- SIMP allocation does not apply to MAGI determination

**Different from Non-MAGI:**

This is different from Question 11 (Non-MAGI). For MAGI:
- Tax filer rules control
- Not facility vs. waiver distinction
- Standard MAGI household income methodology

### Q17: How is income allocated from the facility spouse handled in the MAGI budget of the community spouse?

**Answer:**

If the tax household is married filing jointly, then the income of the facility spouse is already being counted in the tax household.

**MAGI Approach:**

- MAGI uses tax household income
- If married filing jointly, both incomes included
- No separate "allocation" concept in MAGI
- All household income counted per tax filer rules

**No Additional Allocation:**

The SIMP income allocation from IM-73 does not apply separately in a MAGI budget. The tax household methodology handles both spouses' income.

### Q18: Will the community spouse receiving Medicaid impact the SOC for the spouse in the facility?

**Answer:**

The community spouse becoming eligible for Medicaid would not impact the SOC amount of the SIMP spouse unless there was a change in the income allocation.

**Same Answer as Q12:**

This answer is the same whether community spouse is MAGI or Non-MAGI.

**General Rule:**

Community spouse's Medicaid eligibility (regardless of category) does not directly impact SIMP spouse's SOC.

**Exception:**

Only if there is a change in the income allocation amount would the SOC be affected.

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Initial Approval Before Transfers:** IM-74 may be completed and Medicaid approved before interspousal transfers finalized; transfers must be completed by first renewal or case closes if over $4,000

✓ **Excess Transfer is Deprivation:** Amount transferred to community spouse above reserved amount counts as deprivation for institutionalized spouse per 444 NAC 26-003.02(D)

✓ **Both Spouses Institutional - SIMP Ends:** When community spouse also receives institutional services, SIMP ends and each spouse budgeted separately with individual resource standards

✓ **Medical Insurance Disregards Allowed:** Spouses' own medical insurance premiums are allowable disregards in SIMP cases; dependent relative premiums are NOT

✓ **MIWD and SIMP Dual Eligibility Rare:** Contact Policy and Production Support for rare cases where individual meets both MIWD and SIMP criteria; N-FOCUS not set up for simultaneous processing

✓ **IM-73 Redo Requires Policy Approval:** Generally completed once; submit policy question with case-specific details if error in calculation warrants redo

✓ **AVS Required with Application:** AVS must be used when valid Medicaid application provides consent; clearly narrate if paper documentation used without application

✓ **Community Spouse Resource Limits:** Apply standard limits for their eligibility category (ABD $4,000, MSP limits, no limit for MAGI); IM-74 doesn't control their resource counting

✓ **Facility vs. Waiver Income/Resource Counting:** If SIMP spouse in facility, count only CS resources and allocated income for CS eligibility; if in-home waiver, count combined resources and both incomes

✓ **MAGI Uses Tax Filer Rules:** Community spouse MAGI cases follow standard tax household income methodology, not SIMP allocation rules; married filing jointly includes both incomes
