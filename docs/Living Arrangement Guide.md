# Living Arrangement Guide

**Living Arrangement Verification & Budgeting**  
*Comprehensive guide to living arrangement determination and impact on Medicaid eligibility*

---

## Overview

The living arrangement of a Non-MAGI or MAGI (including Heritage Health Adult/HHA MAGI Expansion) client can affect Medicaid eligibility at application, renewal, or at the time of a reported change. The client's living arrangement must be reviewed prior to determining eligibility to ensure the client is eligible (477 NAC 11-003.01).

If the client is in a facility, verifying how the facility is licensed and choosing the appropriate living arrangement in NFOCUS will ensure the correct medical income level is used in determining eligibility. Additionally, certain living arrangements have different budgeting procedures, deductions, and allowances which directly affect the Share of Cost (SOC) that is determined when the budget is run. Therefore, creating or updating a budget requires attention to detail.

**MAGI cases** will not have a SOC regardless of living arrangement. However, MAGI cases can be budgeted in living arrangements that would typically be budgeted as Non-MAGI. For MAGI categories other than HHA/MAGI Expansion, the case may need to be transitioned to another Non-MAGI category. For HHA/MAGI Expansion cases see [ABD or HHA Process Flow](ABD%20or%20HHA%20Process%20Flow.md).

**DD Waiver recipients** may have a SOC calculated with the 100% FPL and others may have their SOC calculated off the MNIL. If the worker is budgeting a case, it is important to ensure the client is budgeted in the correct living arrangement. For more information on DD Waiver recipients see the Policy Log: Budgeting DD Waiver Clients.

## Key Definitions

**Living Arrangement**: The type of residence or facility where a Medicaid client resides, which determines medical income levels, allowable deductions, and Share of Cost calculations.

**Share of Cost (SOC)**: The amount a Non-MAGI Medicaid client must contribute toward their medical expenses, calculated based on income, deductions, and living arrangement.

**Medical Income Level**: The income threshold for Medicaid eligibility, which varies by living arrangement type (community vs. institutional).

**Licensed Facility**: A care facility licensed by the state in a specific category (nursing home, assisted living, etc.) as verified through the Facilities & Services Roster.

**Board & Room**: Living arrangement where client receives lodging, utilities, and food in exchange for a fee; requires specific budgeting procedures for DD clients.

**Assisted Living Waiver (ALW)**: Waiver program for clients assessed and approved by a Waiver Service Coordinator who have met qualifications for AD Waiver, PACE, or TBI program.

**Medicare Days**: Period during which Medicare Part A covers nursing home care (up to 100 days with varying cost-sharing), affecting Medicaid budgeting procedures.

**Personal Needs Allowance**: Amount of income a client in institutional care is allowed to retain for personal expenses (varies by living arrangement and program).

**Unlicensed LTC Facility**: Long-term care facility not licensed by the state (e.g., VA facilities, Masonic homes) where Medicaid does not pay for the stay but individual may still be eligible for Medicaid coverage.

**Institute of Mental Disease (IMD)**: Facility of more than 16 beds primarily engaged in providing diagnosis, treatment, or care of persons with mental diseases; Medicaid coverage limited by age (21 or younger, 65 or older).

## Living Arrangement Change Reminders

### Critical Reminders Due to Change in Living Arrangement

**1. Incarceration**
- An individual who is incarcerated is **not eligible** for Medicaid based on their living arrangement except in circumstances outlined in 477 NAC 4-002.01C
- See: [Medicaid Suspension and Hospital Coverage for Incarcerated Individuals Process Guide](Medicaid%20Suspension%20and%20Hospital%20Coverage%20for%20Incarcerated%20Individuals%20Process%20Guide.md)

**2. NFOCUS Living Arrangement Selection**
- Worker should select appropriate living arrangement from NFOCUS drop-down list when updating client's living arrangement

**3. QI1 Budget Considerations**
- If client in QI1 budget enters facility, worker should contact client to determine if appropriate to update budget in current month or for next applicable month
- See: Policy Memo 18-02 QI1 and SOC and Non-MAGI Coverage Options Chart

**4. Homeownership/Rent Deduction (6-Month Rule)**
- Change in living arrangement requires worker to review allowable deductions
- Cost of homeownership or rent and utilities can be allowed for **up to six (6) months** when Non-MAGI client moves to long-term care facility or has assisted living waiver living arrangement (477 NAC 25-003.03(B)(iii))
- **Property exclusions are same for all waiver participants** (aged, disabled, or developmentally disabled)
- Per regulation, agency would **not** allow this deduction for someone receiving waiver services at home
- **Case alert must be set** to process budget for month following end of initial six-month period, if necessary

**5. MAGI to Non-MAGI Transition**
- MAGI participant moving to Non-MAGI budget requires any MAGI allowable deductions to be reviewed and updated in Expert System of NFOCUS, if applicable
- **Example:** Health insurance premiums entered differently based on MAGI or Non-MAGI eligibility
- See: MAGI Transitioning to NON-MAGI and [ABD or HHA Process Flow](ABD%20or%20HHA%20Process%20Flow.md) documents for additional information

**6. Guardian/Conservator Fee Deduction**
- Expense of guardian or conservator fee of **up to $10 per month** is Non-MAGI allowable deduction off client's SOC
- See: WINK-Guardian Conservator Funds, 477 NAC 25-003.02(B)(ii), and 477 NAC 25-003.03(B)(ii)

**7. Assisted Living to Assisted Living Waiver**
- If change in living arrangement is from assisted living to assisted living waiver:
  - Update living arrangement for date change occurred
  - Budget for next possible month taking into account adverse action (do NOT update current month)

**8. Assisted Living Waiver Notice Requirements**

- Assists in eliminating confusion client or facility might have regarding amount owed to facility

**9. Co-pay Implications**
- Living arrangement can determine whether client has co-pay for medical services
- When client moves to LTC facility, living arrangement must be updated in Expert as of date of change to reflect type of LTC facility they are residing in
- Case must be reviewed to determine if budget should be run
- For nursing home and assisted living waiver clients, updating living arrangement in Expert will **stop co-pays even if budget is not processed**
- **Co-pays are tied to living arrangement, not budgeting**

**10. SSI Recipients in Medical Institutions**
- Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients have different regulations for budgeting when move to medical institution occurs (477-000-045 Spenddown Procedures for Institutionalized Individuals: Exception)
- When client is current pay SSI and moves into LTC facility:
  - Client or authorized representative **must be notified by DHHS** to contact Social Security Administration (SSA) and inform their office of change in living arrangement
  - SSA will adjust client's SSI income to **$30 per month**
  - Client may wish to file application for AABD grant with Economic Assistance (EA)
  - EA will determine if client is eligible for grant for personal spending needs
- **If SSA is not notified** of change in living arrangement, overpayment with SSA may occur

**11. Medicare Days**
- Medicare recipients may have Medicare days which require following different set of budgeting rules
- **Case alert must be set** for follow-up on continuation of Medicare days and to process budget when Medicare days end
- See [Medicare Days Information](#medicare-days-information) section below

**12. Supplemental Insurance and Medicare Days**
- Client that has supplemental health insurance and has Medicare days may have remaining Medicare co-pay paid by insurance company

**13. Resource Exclusions**
- When changes in living arrangement occur, worker will need to review case to determine if there are resources client(s) have that will lose their resource exclusion due to move to LTC
- **Example:** Their home

**14. Title II Income Adjustments**
- When changes in living arrangement occur, worker will need to review case to determine if there are Title II income adjustments (Disabled Adult Child or Early Widows/Widowers, for example) that are no longer allowed
- **Title II income adjustments are NOT appropriate** for individuals living in medical institution (nursing home, intermediate care facility, etc.)
- See: [DAC Guide](DAC%20Guide.md) for information about residents of medical institutions

## Special Living Arrangements

### Unlicensed LTC Facilities

**Characteristics:**
- Unlicensed medical facilities (such as Veterans Administration (VA) facilities and Masonic homes) are **not Medicaid enrolled providers**
- Clients in one of these living arrangements can be Medicaid eligible; however, **Medicaid will not pay for their stay** at facility
- See: 471 NAC 2-003.03(2) - Standards for Participation

**Budgeting Procedures:**
1. Unlicensed facilities are budgeted as **Assisted Living**
2. **Shelter costs are not allowed**
3. **Medicaid does not pay facility**
4. Applicant will owe facility the amount they charge minus personal allowance

**Veterans' Benefits:**
- Clients who are veterans, spouse of veteran, or widow of veteran receiving pension may be eligible for **$90 Aide and Attendant Payment** for personal needs when in alternate living arrangement
- See: 477-000-012 Income Levels/Federal Poverty Levels and Resources and 477 NAC 22-005.02(L) - Veterans' Benefits
- When client has been approved for $90 Aid and Attendant payment:
  - Worker should enter amount in unearned income module as **Veterans Personal Needs Allowance**
  - When budget processes, $90 VA payment is not counted as income and will not show on budget

### Drug Treatment Facilities

**Step 1: Review Facility Roster**
- Review Facility Roster to see if facility is licensed as Drug Treatment Center
- MH & SUD Roster

**Step 2: Medicaid Coverage**
- If center is licensed, cost of client's treatment may be paid with Medicaid funds
- **Room and board is not paid by Medicaid**
- Verify with facility who is responsible for cost of room and board
- See: 477-000-044 ABD Standard of Need

### Regional Centers

**Step 1: Verify Unit/Living Arrangement**
- If client is being admitted to or is in regional center, worker must verify unit client will be residing in
- **Medicaid eligibility can be affected** depending on which unit client is in
- Verification done by contacting facility
- See: 477 NAC 11-003.01(B)

**Psychiatric Care Coverage:**
- Psychiatric care is **only covered by Medicaid** to individuals in IMD who are **age 21 or younger** or **age 65 or older**
- If individual is receiving treatment in facility on individual's twenty-first birthday, eligibility continues until either release or month of twenty-second birthday, whichever is sooner

**NFOCUS Entry:**
- In NFOCUS select from available living arrangements found in Expert (Non-Financial tree > Living Arrangement)
- This ensures correct Standard of Need is budgeted

**Medicaid Enrollment:**
- Not all regional centers are Medicaid enrolled providers
- If not enrolled provider and client will be released within next 30 days, application for Medicaid can be submitted on client's behalf

### Hospice

**Key Points:**
1. Client can be on hospice and be eligible for Medicaid
2. **Hospice is not a living arrangement** - it is a service that client can receive
3. Client can receive hospice and waiver services at same time
4. Client on hospice must have living arrangement updated in NFOCUS to reflect applicable living arrangement they are in while receiving hospice

**Examples:**
- **Example 1:** Client residing at their home and receiving hospice must be budgeted with living arrangement of **house**
- **Example 2:** Client residing at assisted living facility and receiving hospice must be budgeted with living arrangement of **assisted living** or **assisted living waiver** - whichever is applicable to that client
