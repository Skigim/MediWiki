LTC Insurance Payment Recovery
Process
Background: MLTC collects insurance payments from LTC (long term care) insurance
companies for payments that are made to nursing facilities on behalf of a Medicaid eligible
individual.
• The LTC Program in the Recovery Cost Avoidance unit works with insurance companies
to obtain these payments.
• These reimbursements go to the Medicaid program to continue funding members of
Medicaid.
• More information regarding the LTC program can be found online:
https://dhhs.ne.gov/Pages/Medicaid-and-Private-Insurance.aspx
The goal of the LTC Program is to ensure that DHHS is being reimbursed for benefits that are
paid on behalf of a Medicaid eligible individual when they enter an assisted living facility or a
nursing home. All payments that are reimbursed by private LTC insurance companies are used to
fund the Medicaid program. 471 NAC 3-005.12
This process assists the Medicaid program in ensuring accurate Medicaid funding is used and
reimbursements from an LTC policy for a Medicaid eligible individual is allocated correctly.
Eligibility Worker Actions
The most important step is the identification of these policies for an individual who is in a
nursing home, assisted living facility, or when a Medicaid eligible individual has passed away.
When working cases, and an LTC policy is identified, the eligibility worker must gather some
information regarding the policy before proceeding:
• Insurance coverage information company name, policy number, etc.
• Whether or not there is a payment being made by the LTC insurance company at the
present time. If there is a payment being made- is it being made to the individual or to a
facility? And the amount of the payment.
• If there is no payment being made, is it because it’s within the first 100 days of the
individual’s stay at the facility: or
• Why is there no payment being made from the policy?
If the insurance policy is not in C1/MMIS already, it must be added by the eligibility worker
prior to sending the email to the LTC Program.
o For instructions on how to enter C1/MMIS, see the C1 TPL Quick Reference Guide for
additional information.
Once the eligibility worker has this information and has added the LTC policy to C1/MMIS, they
must send an email to the LTC Program at DHHS.MedicaidLTCInsurance@Nebraska.gov
informing them that a Medicaid eligible individual has:

• Either passed away or has entered a facility and that they have private LTC insurance.
NOTE: the eligibility worker does not need to email this mailbox if a client has LTC
insurance and is not in an LTC facility.
The email to the LTC Program must contain the following information:
o Individual’s name and Master Case number.
o Medicaid effective date for individual.
o Insurance coverage information company name, policy number, etc.; and
o Power Of Attorney (POA) or Authorized Representative: name, address,
phone number.
The eligibility worker must explain to the individual/ their Authorized Representative that their
LTC policy must be assigned to DHHS and let them know that paperwork will be sent to them
regarding assignment of the policy.
• If the payment is made to the facility, the facility will need to forward the payment to
DHHS and can work with the LTC Program through their process outlined below.
• If the payment is made to the individual, the eligibility worker will obtain the amount of
the payment and enter the reimbursement as unearned income in the individual’s
Medicaid budget.
Throughout the course of each Medicaid case an eligibility worker may receive an electronic
change request on cases from the LTC Program as outlined below. Each case is different and
there will be different times or instances when the reimbursements from LTC policies may or
may not need to be added or removed for an individual’s Medicaid budget as unearned income.
Additionally, there may be instances where a Medicaid case may be sanctioned causing a case
closure for non-cooperation if assignment of benefits to the state is not completed.
LTC Program Actions
Once the LTC insurance policy has been added to C1/MMIS and the email has been sent, the
LTC Program will then create a file and send the Assignment of Benefit letter to the POA,
Authorized Representative or whomever is legally entitled to act on behalf of the Medicaid
eligible individual.
NOTE: the Assignment of Benefit letter is not sent via NFOCUS thus the eligibility caseworker
will not be able to see this in NFOCUS Correspondence.
The LTC Program will set a two-week reminder to ensure the agency has received an Assignment
of Benefit letter for the Medicaid eligible individual.
• If the Assignment of Benefit letter is not returned by the due date:
o A second request is sent with a new due date (two weeks out).
▪ If, after the second request due date, the Assignment of Benefit letter is not
returned:
• The LTC Program must submit an electronic change request
through iServe (https://iserve.nebraska.gov/) requesting the

eligibility worker to add the LTC reimbursements as unearned
income in the individual’s Medicaid budget.
• The eligibility worker will then add the reimbursements to the
individual’s Medicaid budget for the next applicable month, taking
into consideration adverse action.
▪ Later on, if the signed Assignment of Benefit letter is returned, the LTC
Program must submit an electronic change request through iServe
(https://iserve.nebraska.gov/) requesting the eligibility worker remove the
LTC reimbursements from the individual’s Medicaid budget for the month
specified in the change request and recalculate applicable budgets.
Once the Assignment of Benefit letter is returned:
o The LTC Program will then mail the Assignment of Benefit to the LTC insurance
company to ensure their files are updated.
▪ Reimbursements will then be sent directly to DHHS.
▪ This process can take anywhere from one to three months.
• Each insurance company is different; some are quicker to update
than others.
o The LTC Program will set a monthly reminder to review the file to ensure
reimbursements are being received from the LTC insurance company.
▪ If after two months the reimbursements are not sent directly to DHHS, the
LTC Program will contact the insurance company to inquire if they have
received the signed Assignment of Benefit letter or not.
• If they have received the letter, the LTC Program must confirm
whether or not the reimbursements have been sent out.
o If yes, it must be identified where the reimbursements went.
▪ If it has been determined that payment was sent to
the facility, a letter is mailed to the facility to
request the reimbursement be sent to DHHS with a
due date.
• If the reimbursement is not received by the
due date, the LTC Program must submit an
electronic change request through iServe
(https://iserve.nebraska.gov/) requesting the
eligibility worker to add a TPL sanction onto
the Medicaid eligible individual’s case. This
will cause the Medicaid case to close.
o If no, it must be identified why the reimbursements have
not been sent out. The LTC Program must work with the
LTC insurance company to resolve this issue.
▪ If it has been determined that the reimbursement
was sent to the POA or Authorized
Representative, a letter is sent to request the

reimbursement be sent to DHHS with a due date
and regulation information.
o The letter advises that if the
reimbursement is not received by the
due date, the reimbursement will be
added to the individual’s Medicaid
budget.
• If the POA or Authorized Representative
does not respond by the due date, then a
change request is sent to iServe
(https://iserve.nebraska.gov/) requesting the
eligibility worker to add the LTC
reimbursements.
• The eligibility worker will then add the
reimbursements to the individual’s Medicaid
budget for the next applicable month, taking
into consideration adverse action.
o Once the reimbursements are switched and start being sent
directly to DHHS:
▪ The LTC Program must submit an electronic change
request through iServe (https://iserve.nebraska.gov/)
requesting the Medicaid eligibility worker to
remove the LTC reimbursements as unearned
income from the individual’s Medicaid budget and
rerun applicable budgets.

Regulations:
471 NAC 3-005.12
Long Term Care Insurance Policies: A long-term care indemnity policy is considered a health
insurance policy when the policy -
1. Allows assignment of benefits; and
2. Covers medical care based on specified criteria.
Long Term Care insurance which meets these criteria is not considered income for eligibility
determination.
Since nursing facility claims are included in the category of "waiver claims," Nebraska Medicaid
will pay these claims at the specific per diem for the individual less any excess income/share of
cost the individual is obligated to pay the provider for the monthly services. The COB Unit will
seek recovery on all these policies. Since the claims have been paid, the provider shall not bill
the insurer. The provider shall assist the COB Unit in obtaining reimbursement from these
policies by furnishing any medical documentation the insurer requests.
A provider may choose to bill the long-term care insurance; in these situations, the provider does
not bill Medicaid.
If the provider or the individual receives a payment directly from the insurer, the payment shall
be sent to the COB/TPL Unit.
Whenever the Department receives any payments from long term care insurance which exceeds
what Medicaid has paid toward the care of the individual, the Department shall apply the excess
to any Medicaid expenditure for that Medicaid client even if the expenditure was not covered by
the third party. The application of the excess TPL payment is not limited to a particular Medicaid
service and can be applied to any claims for that Medicaid individual paid by Medicaid. After the
excess TPL payment has been applied to all claims, any remaining amount shall be paid to the
individual.

Example of an LTC Program Case List:
• Active- Medicaid eligible individuals who are currently active in Medicaid, are in a
nursing home or Assisted Living Facility (ALF) and who have active LTC insurance
listed in MMIS/C1.
• Closed- Medicaid eligible individuals whose Medicaid case has closed OR who have
reached the maximum amount of LTC benefits that their policy will pay.
• Deceased- Medicaid eligible individuals who have passed away.
• Pending Assignment- NEW Medicaid eligible individuals who have moved into a
nursing home or an Assisted Living Facility, have active private LTC insurance and
the assignment of benefit letters were mailed out to the Power of Attorney,
Authorized Representative or whomever is legally entitled to act on behalf of the
Medicaid eligible individual—this is done by the LTC Program). The LTC Program
is waiting for the signed assignment of benefit letters to be returned so that it can be
sent out to the LTC insurance company letting them know that LTC reimbursements
will need to be sent directly to DHHS.
