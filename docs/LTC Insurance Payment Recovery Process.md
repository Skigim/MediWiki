# LTC Insurance Payment Recovery Process
*Long-Term Care Insurance Reimbursement and Assignment Procedures*

---

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive procedures for the Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance Payment Recovery Process within the Medicaid program. The LTC Program, operated within the Recovery Cost Avoidance unit, works with private insurance companies to obtain reimbursements for payments made to nursing facilities and assisted living facilities on behalf of Medicaid-eligible individuals who also have private LTC insurance policies. These reimbursements are returned to the Medicaid program to continue funding services for Medicaid members.

The goal of the LTC Program is to ensure that DHHS is being reimbursed for benefits paid on behalf of Medicaid-eligible individuals when they enter an assisted living facility or a nursing home and have active private long-term care insurance coverage. All payments reimbursed by private LTC insurance companies are used to fund the Medicaid program in accordance with federal and state regulations.

This process assists the Medicaid program in ensuring accurate Medicaid funding is used and reimbursements from an LTC policy for a Medicaid-eligible individual are allocated correctly.

## Eligibility Worker Actions

### Identifying LTC Insurance Policies

The most important step is the **identification of these policies** for an individual who is in a nursing home, assisted living facility, or when a Medicaid-eligible individual has passed away.

### Information Gathering

When working cases and an LTC policy is identified, the eligibility worker must gather some information regarding the policy before proceeding:

1. **Insurance coverage information:**
   - Company name
   - Policy number
   - Policy details

2. **Current payment status:**
   - Whether or not there is a payment being made by the LTC insurance company at the present time
   - If there IS a payment being made:
     - Is it being made to the individual or to a facility?
     - What is the amount of the payment?

3. **If there is NO payment being made:**
   - Is it because it's within the first 100 days of the individual's stay at the facility?
   - Why is there no payment being made from the policy?

### Adding Policy to C1/MMIS

**If the insurance policy is not in C1/MMIS already, it MUST be added by the eligibility worker prior to sending the email to the LTC Program.**

- For instructions on how to enter C1/MMIS, see the **C1 TPL Quick Reference Guide** for additional information

### Email Notification to LTC Program

Once the eligibility worker has this information and has added the LTC policy to C1/MMIS, they must send an email to the LTC Program at **DHHS.MedicaidLTCInsurance@Nebraska.gov** informing them that a Medicaid-eligible individual has:

- Either **passed away** or has **entered a facility** and that they have private LTC insurance

> **Note:** The eligibility worker does NOT need to email this mailbox if a client has LTC insurance and is NOT in an LTC facility.

**The email to the LTC Program must contain the following information:**

- Individual's name and Master Case number
- Medicaid effective date for individual
- Insurance coverage information (company name, policy number, etc.)
- Power Of Attorney (POA) or Authorized Representative: name, address, phone number

### Explaining Assignment to Individual/Representative

The eligibility worker must explain to the individual or their Authorized Representative that their LTC policy must be assigned to DHHS and let them know that paperwork will be sent to them regarding assignment of the policy.

**Payment Handling:**

- **If the payment is made to the facility:**
  - The facility will need to forward the payment to DHHS
  - The facility can work with the LTC Program through their process outlined below

- **If the payment is made to the individual:**
  - The eligibility worker will obtain the amount of the payment
  - Enter the reimbursement as **unearned income** in the individual's Medicaid budget

### Ongoing Case Management

Throughout the course of each Medicaid case, an eligibility worker may receive an **electronic change request** on cases from the LTC Program as outlined below.

**Important Considerations:**

- Each case is different
- There will be different times or instances when the reimbursements from LTC policies may or may not need to be added or removed for an individual's Medicaid budget as unearned income
- There may be instances where a Medicaid case may be **sanctioned** causing a case closure for non-cooperation if assignment of benefits to the state is not completed

## LTC Program Actions

### Initial Processing

Once the LTC insurance policy has been added to C1/MMIS and the email has been sent, the LTC Program will:

1. **Create a file** for the case
2. **Send the Assignment of Benefit letter** to the POA, Authorized Representative, or whomever is legally entitled to act on behalf of the Medicaid-eligible individual

> **Note:** The Assignment of Benefit letter is NOT sent via NFOCUS, thus the eligibility caseworker will NOT be able to see this in NFOCUS Correspondence.

3. **Set a two-week reminder** to ensure the agency has received an Assignment of Benefit letter for the Medicaid-eligible individual

---

## Assignment of Benefit Process

### First Request Not Returned

**If the Assignment of Benefit letter is NOT returned by the due date:**

1. A **second request is sent** with a new due date (two weeks out)

**If, after the second request due date, the Assignment of Benefit letter is NOT returned:**

1. The LTC Program must submit an **electronic change request through iServe** (https://iserve.nebraska.gov/) requesting the eligibility worker to add the LTC reimbursements as unearned income in the individual's Medicaid budget
2. The eligibility worker will then **add the reimbursements** to the individual's Medicaid budget for the next applicable month, taking into consideration adverse action

**Later on, if the signed Assignment of Benefit letter IS returned:**

1. The LTC Program must submit an **electronic change request through iServe** requesting the eligibility worker to **remove** the LTC reimbursements from the individual's Medicaid budget for the month specified in the change request
2. Recalculate applicable budgets

### Assignment Letter Returned Successfully

**Once the Assignment of Benefit letter is returned:**

1. The LTC Program will then **mail the Assignment of Benefit to the LTC insurance company** to ensure their files are updated
2. **Reimbursements will then be sent directly to DHHS**
3. This process can take anywhere from **one to three months**
   - Each insurance company is different; some are quicker to update than others

**The LTC Program will:**

1. **Set a monthly reminder** to review the file to ensure reimbursements are being received from the LTC insurance company

### Follow-Up When Reimbursements Not Received

**If after two months the reimbursements are NOT sent directly to DHHS:**

The LTC Program will **contact the insurance company** to inquire if they have received the signed Assignment of Benefit letter or not.

**If the insurance company HAS received the letter:**

The LTC Program must confirm whether or not the reimbursements have been sent out.

**If YES, reimbursements have been sent out:**

1. It must be identified **where the reimbursements went**

**If it has been determined that payment was sent to the facility:**

1. A letter is mailed to the facility to **request the reimbursement be sent to DHHS** with a due date
2. **If the reimbursement is NOT received by the due date:**
   - The LTC Program must submit an **electronic change request through iServe** (https://iserve.nebraska.gov/) requesting the eligibility worker to **add a TPL sanction** onto the Medicaid-eligible individual's case
   - This will cause the Medicaid case to close

**If NO, reimbursements have not been sent out:**

1. It must be identified **why the reimbursements have not been sent out**
2. The LTC Program must work with the LTC insurance company to resolve this issue

**If it has been determined that the reimbursement was sent to the POA or Authorized Representative:**

1. A letter is sent to **request the reimbursement be sent to DHHS** with a due date and regulation information
2. The letter advises that if the reimbursement is NOT received by the due date, the reimbursement will be added to the individual's Medicaid budget
3. **If the POA or Authorized Representative does NOT respond by the due date:**
   - A change request is sent to iServe requesting the eligibility worker to **add the LTC reimbursements**
   - The eligibility worker will then add the reimbursements to the individual's Medicaid budget for the next applicable month, taking into consideration adverse action

### Reimbursements Successfully Redirected to DHHS

**Once the reimbursements are switched and start being sent directly to DHHS:**

1. The LTC Program must submit an **electronic change request through iServe** (https://iserve.nebraska.gov/) requesting the Medicaid eligibility worker to **remove the LTC reimbursements as unearned income** from the individual's Medicaid budget
2. Rerun applicable budgets

---

## Non-Cooperation and Sanctions

### TPL Sanction Application

A TPL (Third Party Liability) sanction may be applied to a Medicaid case in the following situations:

1. **Assignment of Benefit not completed** after two requests
2. **Facility does not forward reimbursements** to DHHS after receiving payments from LTC insurance
3. **POA or Authorized Representative does not forward reimbursements** to DHHS after receiving payments

### Impact of TPL Sanction

When a TPL sanction is applied:

- The Medicaid case **will close**
- The individual will lose Medicaid coverage until cooperation is achieved
- The sanction remains until the assignment is completed or reimbursements are forwarded to DHHS

### Avoiding Sanctions

To avoid TPL sanctions, individuals and their representatives should:

- Respond promptly to Assignment of Benefit requests
- Sign and return assignment paperwork within the specified timeframes
- Forward any LTC insurance reimbursements received directly to DHHS
- Maintain communication with the LTC Program regarding any issues

## Regulations

### 471 NAC 3-005.12: Long Term Care Insurance Policies

A long-term care indemnity policy is considered a health insurance policy when the policy:

1. **Allows assignment of benefits**; and
2. **Covers medical care based on specified criteria**

Long Term Care insurance which meets these criteria **is NOT considered income** for eligibility determination.

### Claims Payment and Recovery Process

Since nursing facility claims are included in the category of "waiver claims," Nebraska Medicaid will pay these claims at the specific per diem for the individual **less any excess income/share of cost** the individual is obligated to pay the provider for the monthly services.

**The COB Unit will seek recovery on all these policies.**

Since the claims have been paid, **the provider shall NOT bill the insurer.** The provider shall assist the COB Unit in obtaining reimbursement from these policies by furnishing any medical documentation the insurer requests.

### Alternative: Provider Bills LTC Insurance Directly

A provider may choose to bill the long-term care insurance; in these situations, **the provider does NOT bill Medicaid.**

### Payment Handling Requirements

**If the provider or the individual receives a payment directly from the insurer:**

The payment **shall be sent to the COB/TPL Unit.**

### Excess Payment Application

Whenever the Department receives any payments from long-term care insurance which **exceeds what Medicaid has paid** toward the care of the individual:

1. The Department shall apply the excess to **any Medicaid expenditure for that Medicaid client** even if the expenditure was not covered by the third party
2. The application of the excess TPL payment **is NOT limited to a particular Medicaid service** and can be applied to any claims for that Medicaid individual paid by Medicaid
3. After the excess TPL payment has been applied to all claims, **any remaining amount shall be paid to the individual**

## Cost Avoidance Impact

### Importance of LTC Program

Additional information regarding the importance of the LTC Program and obtaining the necessary information on LTC Insurance policies—it aids in **Cost Avoidance** for the Medicaid Program.

### 2022 Cost Avoidance Results

**In 2022, DHHS:**

- **Cost avoided:** $1,360,685.98
- **Recovered:** $2,707,086.84
- **Combined total:** $4,067,772.82

### 2024 Cost Avoidance Results

**In 2024, DHHS:**

- **Cost avoided:** $1,138,326.66
- **Recovered:** $4,062,084.58
- **Combined total:** $5,200,411.24

### Impact on Medicaid Program

These significant recovery amounts demonstrate the critical importance of:

- Identifying LTC insurance policies promptly
- Obtaining assignments of benefit in a timely manner
- Working cooperatively with insurance companies and facilities
- Following proper procedures for reimbursement collection

All recovered funds are returned to the Medicaid program to continue providing services to Nebraska's Medicaid population.

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Identification is the most important step** – Promptly identifying LTC insurance policies for individuals entering nursing facilities or assisted living facilities is critical to the recovery process.

✓ **LTC policy must be in C1/MMIS before notifying LTC Program** – Eligibility workers must add the LTC insurance policy to C1/MMIS prior to sending notification email to the LTC Program.

✓ **Do not email LTC Program for community-based clients** – Only notify the LTC Program when a client with LTC insurance enters a facility or passes away, not for clients living in the community.

✓ **Assignment of Benefit letters are not visible in NFOCUS** – The LTC Program sends Assignment of Benefit letters outside of NFOCUS, so eligibility workers will not see these in NFOCUS Correspondence.

✓ **Two-request process before adding income** – LTC Program sends two Assignment of Benefit requests before requesting that reimbursements be added as unearned income to the Medicaid budget.

✓ **Processing time is 1-3 months** – Once the Assignment of Benefit is sent to the insurance company, it can take anywhere from one to three months for reimbursements to be redirected to DHHS.

✓ **LTC insurance is not counted as income when properly assigned** – Long-term care indemnity policies that allow assignment of benefits and cover medical care are not considered income for eligibility determination when assigned to DHHS.

✓ **Providers should not bill insurance after Medicaid pays** – Once Medicaid has paid a nursing facility claim, the provider should not bill the LTC insurer; the COB Unit seeks recovery directly.

✓ **TPL sanctions close Medicaid cases** – Failure to cooperate with assignment requirements or failure to forward reimbursements can result in a TPL sanction and Medicaid case closure.

✓ **Significant program savings** – The LTC Program generates millions of dollars annually in cost avoidance and recoveries that fund continued Medicaid services ($5.2 million in 2024).

✓ **Reimbursements are added to budget when assignment not completed** – If the POA or authorized representative does not sign and return the Assignment of Benefit after two requests, the LTC reimbursement amount is added as unearned income in the Medicaid budget.

✓ **Change requests manage budget adjustments** – The LTC Program uses iServe electronic change requests to notify eligibility workers when LTC reimbursements need to be added or removed from Medicaid budgets.
