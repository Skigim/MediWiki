**Pages 31-35: Non-MAGI Retroactive, Living Arrangement, TPL, Budget, SIMP**

---

### Step 8: Retroactive Medicaid Process {#non-magi-retroactive}

• Review the application for any retroactive Medicaid requests.

• Do not pend a retro program case until an eligibility determination can be made (eligible or ineligible).

• Any Authorized Representatives need to be added to the separate Retro Program Case.

• Detailed information and procedures on the Retroactive Medicaid process can be found in the [Retroactive Medicaid Process](Retroactive%20Medicaid%20Process.md) Guide.

---

### Step 9: Living Arrangement {#non-magi-living-arrangement}

• All living arrangements are eligible to be processed as MAGI and Non-MAGI.

• See the [ABD or HHA Process Flow](ABD%20or%20HHA%20Process%20Flow.md) and the [Living Arrangement Guide](Living%20Arrangement%20Guide.md) for further information.

**Incarcerated Individuals:**

Applications must be accepted and Medicaid eligibility determined for individuals who are residing in a 24 hour facility that are being discharged either the month the application was submitted or the month after the application was submitted. Examples of these facilities include Youth Rehabilitation and Treatment Centers, Regional Centers, Department of Corrections facilities, County Jails, and County Youth facilities.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The SUPPORT Act of October 2018 added a provision that applies to applications received for juveniles (defined as individuals under age 21 and individuals who may be eligible under Former Foster Care). The state is required to accept and process applications for individuals up to age 26 at any point during their period of incarceration.

**Universal Staff Duties:**
- For any application received where an individual indicates they are incarcerated, staff must assign the case to the **INC ASSIST position number (66118075)**
- See [Medicaid Position Numbers for Case Assignments](Medicaid%20Position%20Numbers%20for%20Case%20Assignments.md) for further information

**Assigned Staff Duties:**
- Verification of the release date from the facility is required prior to processing the application
- Verifications can be provided from staff at the facility
- The assigned worker will also need to know where the individual will be residing upon discharge, household composition, tax household information, and verification of income of any individual who would be financially responsible for the client based on the tax filing status

---

### Step 10: Third Party Liability (TPL)/Deductions {#non-magi-tpl-deductions}

• Check to see if any applicants are covered by TPL. See the [TPL Guide](TPL%20Guide.md), Guide, and WINK – Understanding the Parts of Medicare for further information.

**If applicants with TPL are approved, policy information must be entered into C1:**

- Application should be reviewed to determine if the household has provided adequate TPL information to add insurance to C1
- Review Document Imaging (DI) for copies of the card which may have already been provided
- C1 may be reviewed to determine if policy was already entered

**If information is not available:**
- Attempt a call to the individual to obtain the needed information
- A call-out to the TPL provider may also be appropriate if you are attempting to verify minimal information, such as: start date/end date, who is covered, etc.

**As a last resort, send a VR requesting a copy of the insurance card:**
- **Do not delay processing of the case if the insurance card or other policy information is all that is needed.** Process the case and then send a VR requesting TPL verification
- If the VR for TPL information is not received, any active adults in the case covered by the TPL should be closed for "Failed to Provide Information". Children are not affected by FTP TPL information and must remain open

---

### Step 11: Process and Review Budget {#non-magi-budget}

**Prior to processing the budget:**

- Refer to the [AVS Procedural Guide](AVS%20Procedural%20Guide.md)
- The AVS processing time (10 days) should be completed prior to a determination
- If an exception is met, see [Expedited AVS Process Reasons](Expedited%20AVS%20Process%20Reasons.md) for further information
- Enter the AVS results in the Expert system

**When all information is available to run the budget:**
- Start running the budgets from the application month forward through the come up month
- Review budget for correctness
- When running budgets, the come-up month must be processed. NFOCUS will take the worker through the needed budgets as long as the worker does not cancel out
- The worker must run the current and come-up month budgets anytime configuration is changed
- If a budget is run after cutoff, the next two months must be run

**If budget is correct:**
- Authorize budget
- Determine eligibility if budget is incorrect
- Make corrections as needed
- Authorize budget
- Determine eligibility

---

### Step 12: Notices {#non-magi-notices}

• Generate and Send Notice of Action. Review once the case is checked in to assure that appropriate information is displayed on the notice. May need to update comments with specific information that may not be captured.

- If notice is generated for "Failed to Provide Information", staff may communicate missing information

---

### Step 13: CHARTS Referral {#non-magi-charts}

• After processing, determine if a Referral to CSE (CHARTS Referral) needs to be made. See the [Child Support Referral Guide](Child%20Support%20Referral%20Guide.md) for further information on submitting a CHARTS referral.

---

### Step 14: Voter Registration {#non-magi-voter-registration}

• Check the application to determine if the individual requested to apply to register to vote. See the [Voter Registration SOP](Voter%20Registration%20SOP%207.2021.md) for further information.

• If the individual requested to register to vote offer link to register on-line:
- https://www.nebraska.gov/apps-sos-voter-registration/ or provide Voter Registration form
- A printable PDF version: https://sos.nebraska.gov/elec/pdf/vr-fillable.pdf

---

### Step 15: Narrate {#non-magi-narrate}

• Narrate – include information that explains the actions taken in a way that others can follow the work completed on the case.

**If case is approved:**
- Narrate through the Approval subject and subheadings

**If case is denied for "Failed to Provide Information":**
- Indicate missing information and day 90 from the application date

**If case remains pending past the required timeframes for an eligibility determination:**
- The worker must review the case and document in the narrative the reason a decision is unable to be made

---

### Step 16: Case Mode {#non-magi-case-mode}

• Check mode to see if case is in correct mode.

- **Processing mode** will remain if denied for "Failed to Provide Information"
- If case was in Assigned mode when denied for FTP, manually change the mode to Processing
- If case was in Assigned mode when denied for reasons other than FTP, manually change the Mode to Change Management
- If denied for any other reason the system will change the mode to Change Management

---

### Step 17: Information Provided Within 90 Days of Application on Denied Case {#non-magi-90-days}

• Determine if it is within the 90 days from the application date. If within 90 days and:

**All information / verifications are present:**
- Re-pend and process the same day

**If still unable to process:**
- Do not re-pend the case
- Send speed note stating what information / verifications are still needed

See [Changes Reported During 90 Day Redetermination Period](Changes%20Reported%20During%2090%20Day%20Redetermination%20Period.md) for further information on the process to take when a new change is reported during the 90 day redetermination period.

**PROCESS COMPLETE**

**NOTE:** The following sections from the MLTC Processing Guide have been moved to the Non-MAGI & Combined Renewal Process Guide:
- Non-MAGI Renewal (Non-SSI)
- Non-MAGI Renewal SSI/1619(b)
- The renewal steps of the Spousal Impoverishment Case – ASSIGNED section below

---

## Spousal Impoverishment Case – ASSIGNED

### Step 1: Begin {#simp-begin}

• Identify case as being a Spousal Impoverishment (SIMP) case. Determine the individual's specified living arrangement.

**If you will not be the assigned worker:**
- Transfer to the appropriate position number
- See [Medicaid Position Numbers for Case Assignments](Medicaid%20Position%20Numbers%20for%20Case%20Assignments.md)
- The process for the worker not assigned to the Spousal Impoverishment cases is completed

**If you will be the assigned worker for the Spousal Impoverishment Case:**
- Continue to step 2

---

### Step 2: Assign Case {#simp-assign}

• Ensure all of the Medicaid program cases are assigned.

**Determine next steps based on existing documentation:**
- **If there is no Assessment of Resources (IM-73):** continue to step 3
- **If there is an Assessment of Resources (IM-73), but no Designation of Resources (IM-74):** continue to step 7
- **If both the Assessment and Designation have previously been completed for this individual:** continue processing the SIMP case

---

### Step 3: Determine Month for the Assessment of Resources {#simp-assessment-month}

• Determine the month the spouse in the specified living arrangement began a stay of 30 consecutive days in a specified living arrangement.

---

### Step 4: Contact the Individual or Case Representative {#simp-contact}

• Explain the purpose of Spousal Impoverishment and the Assessment and Designation Process. Gather resource declarations for the month the IM-73 will need to be completed.

**If there is a valid application:**
- Submit an AVS request for the applicant and spouse
- If the month of assessment will not be verified in the 60 month look back, phone/paper verification of accounts will be required

**If this is a request for an assessment only:**
- Do not use AVS to verify accounts
- Phone/paper verification of all resource types will be required

• Request proof of other Resource type values for the month needed for the IM-73.

---

### Step 5: Review Verifications and Prepare the IM-73 {#simp-im73-prep}

• Review Resource verifications as they are received, considering if verifications are complete or if additional verification is needed.

• When Resource verification is completed prepare the IM-73 to be signed.

• Advise the couple of the resource limits, allowable reductions of resources, and future steps.

---

### Step 6: Complete IM-73 {#simp-im73-complete}

• Obtain all signatures on the IM-73 and receive the completed IM-73.

**If the couple's resources exceed the allowable amounts for the community spouse and the individual:**
- They may need to wait to apply for Medicaid, or if application has been filed, deny the application
- Change the Medicaid Program Case to Change Management
- The process is complete

**When budgeting:**
- Follow the [Resource Verification](Resource%20Verification.md) Plan and the Resource Verification WINK-ed

**If the couple's resources are within guidelines:**
- Case remains assigned
- Continue to Step 7 in this section

---

### Step 7: Determine if Application is Needed or Received and Complete IM-74 {#simp-im74}

• Check to see if an application is needed. If so, send VR to request an application be filed. If application has not been received when VR is due, change the Medicaid Program Case to Change Management. The process is complete.

• If we have a valid application, check that the Community Spouse has been added so interfaces will be received.

• When Resources are verified within permitted limits, contact the individual or case representative to explain the Designation of Resource process and determine how the couple wants to designate the Resources. Complete the IM-74 and obtain all signatures.

---

### Step 8: Receive Signed IM-74 {#simp-signed-im74}

• Receive signed IM-74. Process the case, entering resources as indicated on the IM-74, and using SIMP budgeting.

- Follow the steps in the [SIMP Budgeting Q & A](SIMP%20Budgeting%20Q%20%26%20A.md) and the Tip of the Week: Spousal Impoverishment (SIMP) Interspousal Transfers

---

### Step 9: Renewal of SIMP case {#simp-renewal}

• Follow the steps in the Non-MAGI & Combined Renewal Process Guide. Additionally, verify the following information:

**Required verifications:**
- Verify the living arrangement of the individual and community spouse
- Verify Income of community spouse and/or family members included in the calculation of the SIMP budget. If verified income equals or exceeds the maintenance need standard, additional income verification is not needed
- Verify shelter and utility costs for community spouse and/or family members
- Verify health insurance premiums and who is covered for all family members
- Verify the Resources of the individual per the [AVS Procedural Guide](AVS%20Procedural%20Guide.md) and the [Resource Verification](Resource%20Verification.md) Plan and the Resource Verification WINK-ed
  - Compare the participant's current resources to the IM-74 and determine if additional verification of interspousal transfers is required
  - If the Medicaid spouse transferred assets to the community spouse, ensure the community spouse remained at or below their reserved amount at the time of the transfer
  - Process SIMP Budget. See Tip of the Week: [Spousal Impoverishment](Spousal%20Impoverishment.md) (SIMP) Interspousal Transfers
