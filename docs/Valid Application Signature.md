A valid application must contain:
1. **Name** of the applicant
2. **Address** of the applicant  
3. **Signature** that meets validity requirements

### What This Document Does NOT Cover

## Worker Review Responsibilities

### Review Signatures at Individual Level

The signature on an application may not be valid for all individuals on the application. This may require other household members to file their own application.

**Critical Rule**: Review a signature on an application **at the individual level**.

### When Signature is Invalid

If an application is being denied for no valid signature:
- A Notice of Action (NOA) **cannot** be sent
- A Verification Request (VR) **cannot** be sent
- Worker needs to send a **Speed Note** or contact the applicant via phone

### Partial Household Approvals

If there are other household members being approved, and there is an individual without a valid signature, staff need to ensure the applicant with the invalid signature is not on the NOA. This may require a **generic NOA** instead of the system-generated NOA.

---

## Invalid Signature Procedures

### When Application is Invalid

Send a **Speed Note** or contact the applicant via phone for an application/individual that has been determined to be invalid.

The individual:
- Cannot be left pending
- Must be denied

### Speed Note Content

A comment may be added to the Speed Note letting the individual(s) know they could:
- File a new application, OR
- Submit documentation to support a valid signature on their application (such as an Authorized Representative form)

### Authorized Representative Timing

The authorized representative (AR) would still be recognized as valid for an application received prior to the date the AR assignment is verified.

**If an AR form is received after the application date**: It is considered an allowable change to make the AR valid (as long as it is received within the 90-day timeframe of the application). This would allow the AR to work with the agency regarding the individual's application.

## Valid Signature Examples

### Example #1: Tax Filer Signs for Entire Tax Household

**Scenario**: Phillip and his wife Vivian have applied for Medicaid for themselves and their three adult children. The children live in the home with Phillip and Vivian and are claimed as dependents on their parents' tax return.

**Result**: ✓ **VALID** - The application is valid for all household members as this application was filed by the tax filer for members of the same tax household.

### Example #2: Non-Tax Household Members

**Scenario**: Danny has applied for Medicaid for himself, his adult daughter DJ, and her three sons. Danny files a tax return as a single filer and claims no dependents. DJ files her own return as a single tax filer and claims her three children.

**Result**: 
- ✓ **VALID** for Danny
- ✗ **NOT VALID** for DJ or her children (not part of the same tax household)

### Example #3: Mixed Household with Minor Child

**Scenario**: Tim and his wife Jill have applied for Medicaid for themselves and their three children. Two of the children are adults, and the youngest child is still a minor. The family does not file taxes.

**Result**:
- ✓ **VALID** for Tim, Jill, and their youngest minor child
- ✗ **NOT VALID** for the two adult children (not part of the same tax household; parents cannot apply on their behalf as they are adults)

**Alternative**: If Tim and Jill file a tax return and claim all the children (the minor child and the two adult children), then the application is valid for all five (5) household members.

### Example #4: Foster Child - CFS Worker Signature

**Scenario**: Jason and Maggie have a foster child placed with them, Luke. Luke is a non-filer and will not be claimed as a tax dependent. Luke's CFS worker completes an application on his behalf.

**Result**: ✓ **VALID** - Luke is a state ward and the CFS worker has the authority to sign the application on his behalf.

### Example #5: Hospital Social Worker - Incarcerated Individual

**Scenario**: Jerry, who is not enrolled in Medicaid, becomes incarcerated. During his incarceration, Jerry is injured and requires hospitalization for three days to recover from his injury. A hospital social worker completes an application on his behalf, assigning herself as the authorized representative and signing the application.

**Result**: ✗ **NOT VALID** - The application is not signed by Jerry, a member of Jerry's family, tax household, or an approved representative. An authorized representative must be assigned by the applicant or client, and because Jerry was not incapacitated, the hospital social worker is not able to sign on his behalf.

**Alternative**: If Jerry would have been **incapacitated** (unable to act on his own behalf), then the application would be considered valid due to the signature of the hospital social worker. The hospital social worker's signature is valid on this application because they are a hospital employee/medical provider. This example aligns with current policy: Policy Memo 17-03.

### Example #6: Boyfriend/Girlfriend - Not Valid

**Scenario**: Carol has applied for herself, her boyfriend Frank, and their minor daughter Lily. Carol is a single filer and will claim Lily. Frank is a non-filer.

**Result**:
- ✓ **VALID** for Carol and Lily
- ✗ **NOT VALID** for Frank (he is not part of the same tax household and is not related to Carol)

**Alternative Scenarios**:
- If Frank claims Lily: Application is still only valid for Carol and Lily
- If Carol claims Lily **and** Frank: Application would be valid for all applicants

### Example #7: Non-Custodial Parent Signature

**Scenario**: Lindsay's non-custodial parent, Dave, applies on her behalf. Lindsay primarily lives with her mother, Susan, however Dave will claim Lindsay as a tax dependent.

**Result**: ✓ **VALID** - Lindsay is a member of Dave's tax household (non-custodial parent), and he is an immediate family member.

### Example #8: Stamped Signature - Authorized Representative

**Scenario**: Charles is a client at the Beatrice State Developmental Center (BSDC) and is due for renewal. BSDC is Charles' designated authorized representative. Staff at BSDC complete the renewal and sign via a stamp on the renewal form.

**Result**: ✓ **VALID** - The form is signed by the client's authorized representative. The stamped signature is valid because the individual who signed intended to sign and had the authority to sign.

**Note**: For purposes of a signature, this includes: a stamp, name, sign, or a pictogram.

### Example #9: Electronic/Digital Signature

**Scenario**: Janet is applying for Medicaid. Janet completes the application by downloading the PDF version of the application and completing it electronically, including filling out the signature line digitally.

**Result**: ✓ **VALID** - Signatures completed electronically can be valid, and the application was signed by Janet herself.

### Example #10: Temporary Guardian (LB157)

**Scenario**: Stacy is an incapacitated individual with a medical emergency need. Clint has been appointed as a temporary guardian for Stacy by the court and submits an application on Stacy's behalf per LB157. The court order in DI indicates this is a limited temporary guardianship and that Clint has the authority to complete and sign the Medicaid application and facilitate eligibility for Stacy.

**Result**: ✓ **VALID** - Both the court order and the application are reviewed. The application is considered valid per Policy Memo 23-09.

## Authorized Representative Signatures

### AR Assignment Timing

An authorized representative would still be recognized as valid for an application received **prior to** the date the AR assignment is verified.

### AR Form Received After Application

If an AR form is received **after the application date**, it is considered an **allowable change** to make the AR valid, as long as it is received within the **90-day timeframe** of the application.

This allows the AR to work with the agency regarding the individual's application.

### Who Can Be an AR

Valid authorized representatives include:
- Family members designated by the applicant
- Legal representatives (power of attorney, guardian)
- Agency representatives (CFS workers for state wards)
- Medical providers (in cases of incapacitation)
