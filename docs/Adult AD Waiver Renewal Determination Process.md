## Legal Authority & MOE Unwind Context

**Applicable Regulations:**
- 477 NAC 3: Underlying eligibility timeliness requirements
- 477 NAC 27: Medical documentation timeliness requirements
- Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (passed December 2022)

**MOE Unwind Context:**

Through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, the PHE was separated from the MOE requirement. Nebraska began MOE Unwind effective March 1, 2023, with adverse actions beginning April 1, 2023, after completion of MOE Unwind Renewals.

**For cases requiring disability determination by SRT:**
- If Medical Impairment Review date is BEFORE the Medicaid MOE Unwind Renewal due date: Extend the Medical Impairment Review date to align with MOE Unwind Renewal date
- If Medical Impairment Review date is AFTER the Medicaid MOE Unwind Renewal due date: Begin process with alert generated 60 days prior to Medical Impairment Review date

## Key Takeaways

✓ **MOE Unwind Changes Process:** Be aware of special MOE Unwind considerations; understand whether medical review dates align with Medicaid renewal dates for proper scheduling.

✓ **Renewal Differs from Initial:** Renewal cases with previous approved disabilities proceed more directly to clinical review; failure to complete renewal results in both Medicaid AND AD Waiver loss.

✓ **30-Day First Request:** SRT VR#1 allows 30 days for medical documentation submission; this is the critical window for file completion.

✓ **21-Day Second Request:** If additional records are needed, SRT VR#2 allows only 21 days for submission; shorter window requires prompt action.

✓ **Service Coordinator Coordination:** E&E Unit and Service Coordinator must coordinate with disability determination to avoid unplanned service gaps or discharge delays.

✓ **Clinical Guidelines Applied:** SRT RN and MD both apply SSA Clinical guidelines; multiple review touchpoints ensure thorough clinical assessment.

✓ **90-Day Appeal Grace Period:** Denied individuals have 90 days to appeal; case remains assigned during this period to support appeal process if filed.

✓ **Parallel Processing:** While SRT conducts disability review, other Medicaid activities may proceed; avoid delays by managing all Medicaid actions concurrently where appropriate.
