Maintenance of Eligibility (MOE) Unwind process or adjustments are noted in ‘Orange’
text.
Maintenance of Eligibility Unwind (MOE Unwind) – Through the Consolidated Appropriations Act
of 2023 that was passed by Congress at the end of December 2022, the PHE has been
separated out from the MOE requirement. The State of Nebraska has opted to begin the MOE
Unwind effective 3/1/2023. Adverse action on cases can begin on April 1st , 2023, after an MOE
Unwind Renewal is completed.
For cases requiring a disability determination by the State Review Team:
• If the Medical Impairment Review date is BEFORE the Medicaid MOE Unwind Renewal
due date, the Medical Impairment Review date will be extended to align with the
Medicaid MOE Unwind Renewal date.
• If the Medical Impairment Review date is AFTER to the Medicaid MOE Unwind Renewal
date, the process will begin with the alert that is generated 60 days prior to the Medical
Impairment Review date.
Please refer to the MLTC MOE Unwind Guidance for additional information.
Process:
1) Eligibility Operations initiates the SRT renewal process.
a) Eligibility Operations will review the list of cases that have both a required SRT review
and the Medicaid renewal is due to determine if SRT is still needed. Eligibility Operations
will notify the SRT of any cases that a Medical Review is indicated, but is no longer
needed. The remainder will continue to step b)
i) Once a MOE Unwind renewal has been completed, disability determination reviews
will return to being based on the SRT approval period.
b) Eligibility Operations SSW receives the alert that the Medicaid renewal is due, and will
review the case to determine if SRT is needed; if not needed, stop here. If needed,
move to step c)
c) The case is assigned to position number 75013343, and then assigned to an SSW for
the SRT process;
d) The Eligibility Operations Assigned SSW attempts to reach the individual or their
representative within 2 days of case assignment:
e) If contact is:
i) Made - the Eligibility Operations Assigned SSW:
(1) Explains the SRT renewal process and that a SRT VR#1 will be arriving in the
mail with documents for them to give to their medical provider(s); if this is a
renewal of an individual with a previous SRT review that could not be completed
or the individual did not meet disability criteria, inform them that the SRT review
is required. Failure to complete the review at this time will result in a loss of
Medicaid eligibility, and therefore AD Waiver eligibility.
(2) Completes the DM-12 with the individual or their representative and uploads it to
DI; if the SRT review is overdue due to the SOE then the DM-12 should reflect a

Medicaid and AD Waiver eligibility.
The enclosed DM-5 form needs to be completed by your medical provider who
knows the most about your disability. This form allows that provider to describe your
disability. Give it to your provider to fill out.
