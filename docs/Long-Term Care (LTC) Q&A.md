## Section 1: MAGI and Level of Care

### Q1: Can an individual receive institutionalized care in a facility or waiver services in their home if covered by MAGI?

**Answer:**

Yes, a MAGI eligible individual may receive care in a facility including in home waiver services.

**Important Considerations:**

However, there are various eligibility factors for waiver depending on the type of waiver program. Each waiver has specific:
- Level of care requirements
- Service criteria
- Income and resource limits
- Program-specific eligibility rules

**Process Guidance:**

The **ABD or HHA/MAGI Expansion Process Flow** provides more information on waiver requests in MAGI budgeting.

**Key Points:**

1. **MAGI Category Does Not Prevent LTC:**
   - MAGI eligibility does not exclude individual from receiving institutional care
   - Can receive services in nursing facility
   - Can receive waiver services in home or community

2. **Waiver Type Matters:**
   - Different waivers have different requirements
   - E&E unit determines waiver-specific eligibility
   - Worker responsible for Medicaid category determination

3. **Coordination Required:**
   - Eligibility worker maintains MAGI category
   - E&E unit handles waiver enrollment and services
   - Both components must be active for services to be provided

**Examples:**

- Individual eligible under Parent/Caretaker MAGI category requests AD Waiver: MAGI category continues, E&E determines waiver eligibility
- Child covered under CHIP MAGI category needs nursing facility care: MAGI coverage continues while receiving facility services

## Section 2: Spousal Budgeting and Resources

### Q2: A married couple is receiving an institutionalized level of care, should they be budgeted in the same program case?

**Answer:**

No, eligibility is determined separately for each spouse.

**Budgeting Requirements:**

**Consider Each Spouse Individually:**
- Income and resources each spouse has in their own name
- Each spouse's separate eligibility

**If Both Spouses Are Eligible for Medicaid Category:**

1. **Open each in their own master case** with their own Medicaid program case
2. **Be sure to list the spouse not in the master case as "Out of Household"**
3. **Each spouse shall be allowed a resource standard for one**

**Regulatory Reference:** 477 NAC 24-001.02B4

**Why This Matters:**

When both spouses require institutional level of care:
- They are not considered a "couple" for budgeting purposes
- Each receives individual resource allowance
- Income and resources are counted separately
- Each spouse's share of cost calculated independently

**Important Distinctions:**

**This situation is DIFFERENT from Spousal Impoverishment (SIMP):**
- SIMP applies when ONE spouse needs LTC, other does not
- When BOTH spouses need LTC, each budgeted separately
- No community spouse resource allowance applies
- No spousal income allowance applies

**Practical Example:**

Husband and wife both in nursing facility:
- Open Master Case 1 for Husband with his Medicaid program case
- Open Master Case 2 for Wife with her Medicaid program case
- List Wife as "Out of Household" in Husband's case
- List Husband as "Out of Household" in Wife's case
- Each gets $2,000 resource standard (not $3,000 combined)

## Section 3: Waiver Referrals and Timing

### Q3: If a Medicaid eligibility determination hasn't been made, should the worker wait to send a waiver referral?

**Answer:**

Generally, yes—but there are important exceptions.

**General Rule:**

The Eligibility & Enrollment (E&E) unit will want to see if the individual is eligible for Medicaid before determining waiver eligibility.

**Exception 1: Deprivation Review**

The worker **may send a referral for a LOC request** due to possible deprivation.

**Why:** 
- LOC determination needed to establish when deprivation lookback begins
- Helps determine if individual subject to deprivation review
- Allows parallel processing of complex cases

**Exception 2: SIMP Budgeting**

The worker **may also send a referral to request a LOC** if a LOC determination is needed for SIMP budgeting.

**Why:**
- LOC determination affects SIMP assessment
- Determines if spousal impoverishment provisions apply
- Needed to calculate community spouse resource allowance

**Best Practice:**

1. **Standard Cases:** Complete Medicaid eligibility determination first, then refer for waiver LOC
2. **Deprivation Cases:** May send LOC referral while processing Medicaid eligibility if deprivation review needed
3. **SIMP Cases:** Send LOC referral when needed for accurate SIMP calculation even if Medicaid eligibility pending

**Coordination:**

- Communicate with E&E unit about timing and case complexity
- Document reason for early referral in case narrative
- Follow up on both Medicaid eligibility and LOC determination

## Section 4: Resource Limits and Communication

### Q4: If an application is denied for being over resources, should a VR be sent advising the client to spend down resources and reapply?

**Answer:**

No, a VR should not be sent for this purpose.

**Proper Procedure:**

If the client is over the resource limit, the worker **may contact the applicant for further conversation** on the resource limits of the program.

**Why Not Send VR:**

1. **VRs are for requesting verification**, not for providing advice or counseling
2. **Inappropriate use of formal verification process** for what should be verbal communication
3. **Personal contact is more appropriate** for explaining options and answering questions

**Recommended Approach:**

**Direct Phone Contact:**
- Call applicant to discuss denial reason
- Explain resource limit for the program
- Discuss what resources counted and why

**Explain Options:**
- Discuss legitimate spend-down options
- Explain reapplication process
- Provide information about excluded resources
- Discuss timing for reapplication

**Do NOT Advise:**
- How to transfer or hide assets (deprivation)
- Specific financial transactions to make
- When/how to give away resources

**Appropriate Information to Provide:**

✓ Current resource limit for program  
✓ What resources are countable  
✓ What resources are excluded  
✓ That they can reapply when resources are within limits  
✓ Contact information for additional questions

✗ Do not advise on specific financial transactions  
✗ Do not suggest asset transfers or gifts  
✗ Do not provide financial planning advice

**Documentation:**
Document conversation in case narrative including:
- Date and time of contact
- Information provided
- Client's questions and responses
- Any follow-up needed

## Section 5: Facility Coordination and Per Diem Rates

### Q5: Who should the worker speak with at the facility to determine the per diem rates or level of care?

**Answer:**

Contact the business or billing department, not nursing staff.

**Appropriate Contacts at Facility:**

Every facility is different, but typically it will be an employee in:
- **Business Office**
- **Patient Accounts**
- **Billing Specialist**
- **Accounting Department**

**Who NOT to Contact:**

An employee in the nursing unit generally does **not** have the cost of care information available to them.

**Nursing staff focus on:**
- Patient care
- Medical needs
- Clinical documentation

**Business staff have:**
- Per diem rates
- Private pay rates
- Medicare/Medicaid rates
- Billing and cost information

**If Initial Attempts Unsuccessful:**

If attempts to obtain the per diem rates are not successful, staff may need to reach out to the **facility administrator**.

**Facility Administrator has:**
- Overall authority and access
- All rate information
- Ability to direct you to correct department
- Final say on rate disclosure

**What Information to Request:**

1. **Current per diem rate** (daily rate for care)
2. **Whether rate is private pay or Medicaid**
3. **Effective date of current rate**
4. **Any anticipated rate changes**
5. **What services are included in per diem** (vs. separately billed)

**Additional Guidance:**

For further information on budgeting per diem rates, see the **Additional Excess Income Guide**.

**Documentation:**
- Document contact name and title
- Document rate and effective date
- Document source (phone call, written verification)
- Save any written rate confirmations to Document Imaging

**Best Practices:**

- Maintain list of business office contacts for frequently used facilities
- Ask for direct phone number or email for billing department
- Request written confirmation of rates when possible
- Verify rates annually or when notified of changes

## Section 6: Prescription Coverage in Facilities

### Q6: Are medications covered by Medicaid when someone is in a nursing facility?

**Answer:**

It depends on several factors. Prescription coverage in facilities is complex.

**Variables That Affect Coverage:**

**Factor 1: Medicare Eligibility and Part D Coverage**
- If individual has Medicare Part D plan
- What medications are covered under their Part D plan
- Whether medication is on plan formulary
- Part D coverage periods and gaps

**Factor 2: Patient Agreement with Facility**
- Terms of admission agreement
- Whether facility contracts with specific pharmacy
- What facility agreement says about medication billing
- Who is responsible for medication costs

**Important Points:**

**Complex Interplay:**
- Medicare Part D may be primary coverage
- Medicaid may be secondary
- Facility agreement affects billing
- Effective dates of coverage matter

**Client Questions:**

If the client has questions about:
- Whether a particular medication is paid by Medicaid, OR
- The billing statement they receive

**Encourage them to:**
- Work with the facility
- Work with the pharmacy
- Discuss coverage and effective dates of coverage

**Why This Approach:**

1. **Facility has direct information** about their billing practices
2. **Pharmacy knows** what was billed to which payer
3. **Part D plan** has specific formulary and coverage rules
4. **Eligibility worker** cannot determine medication-specific coverage

**Additional Resource:**

The **Medicare Part D Co-pay Deductions Q&A** contains further information on this topic.

**What Worker CAN Confirm:**

✓ Whether Medicaid is active  
✓ Effective dates of Medicaid coverage  
✓ Whether individual has Medicare coverage  
✓ General information about Medicaid pharmacy benefits

**What Worker CANNOT Determine:**

✗ Whether specific medication covered by Part D plan  
✗ Which payer (Medicare or Medicaid) should pay for specific drug  
✗ Why specific charges appear on billing statement  
✗ How facility bills prescriptions

**Referral Path:**

- **Facility Billing/Business Office:** Questions about facility charges and billing practices
- **Pharmacy:** Questions about medication coverage and claims submission
- **Medicare Part D Plan:** Questions about formulary and Part D coverage
- **Medicaid Pharmacy:** General Medicaid pharmacy benefit questions

## Section 7: Facility Transitions and Notices

### Q7: If the participant moves from one facility into another, which facility should receive notice?

**Answer:**

It depends on whether there is a change in the benefit amount.

**Scenario 1: Change in Benefit for Month of Transition**

**If there IS a change in the benefit for the month of transition:**

**Send notice to:**
- Both facilities (old and new), AND
- The participant

**Why:**
- Old facility needs to know coverage ending
- New facility needs to know coverage beginning
- Both may bill for partial month
- Participant needs to understand their responsibility

**Scenario 2: Change in Facilities with NO Change to SOC Amount**

**When there is a change in facilities with NO change to the SOC amount:**

**Send notice to:**
- Only the new facility

**Why This is Needed:**

When the facility calls the MMIS number, they are only provided with information that the Medicaid benefit is active, **not the SOC amount**.

**Facility Needs:**
- Actual SOC dollar amount
- Effective date
- Written documentation for their records
- Billing reference

**Old facility:**
- Already has previous notice with SOC amount
- Will bill through discharge date
- Has documentation from prior authorization

**Additional Guidance:**

The **Long-Term Care (LTC) Wink-ed** contains further information on this topic.

**Best Practices:**

1. **Always Send to Participant:**
   - Participant always receives copy of any notice
   - Required for due process
   - Allows participant to verify accuracy

2. **Document Facility Change:**
   - Note facility change in case narrative
   - Document which notices sent to which facilities
   - Update facility address in N-FOCUS

3. **Verify MMIS Update:**
   - Ensure facility change updated in MMIS
   - New facility should appear as servicing provider
   - Old facility billing should end at discharge

4. **Coordinate Timing:**
   - Process notice in time for seamless transition
   - Consider partial month billing for both facilities
   - Verify no gaps or overlaps in coverage

**Example Scenarios:**

**Example 1 - SOC Changes:**
- Mr. Smith moves from Facility A to Facility B on June 15
- SOC increases from $500 to $600 due to facility rate change
- Send notice to Facility A, Facility B, and Mr. Smith
- Notice shows change effective June 15

**Example 2 - SOC Stays Same:**
- Mrs. Jones moves from Facility C to Facility D on July 1
- SOC remains $450 (same rate at both facilities)
- Send notice only to Facility D and Mrs. Jones
- Facility C already has notice showing $450 SOC

## Section 8: N-FOCUS Budget Setup

### Q8: How do I set the waiver budget to be ACTIVE and not Spend Down?

**Answer:**

Select ACTIVE when the SPEND DOWN window pops up during authorization.

**Proper Procedure:**

**Step 1: Authorize the MN Budget**
- Process budget authorization as normal

**Step 2: SPEND DOWN Window Appears**
- Window will pop up automatically

**Step 3: Select "Active"**
- This is the critical step
- Choose "Active" from the options

**Result:**

This results in the program case displaying as **ACTIVE** in the Detail MC screen.

**Correct Display:**
- Program case shows as ACTIVE
- Individual can receive waiver services
- Budget is properly configured

**Incorrect Configuration to AVOID:**

Cases with active waiver should **NOT** be set to SPEND DOWN.

**Why This Matters:**

**If Set to SPEND DOWN:**
- Waiver services may not be properly authorized
- E&E unit cannot activate waiver
- Individual cannot receive services
- Budget does not function correctly

**If Set to ACTIVE:**
✓ Waiver properly authorized  
✓ Services can be provided  
✓ Budget functions correctly  
✓ E&E can process waiver enrollment

**Common Mistakes:**

✗ Accidentally selecting Spend Down instead of Active  
✗ Confusing MN category with Spend Down status  
✗ Not understanding the SPEND DOWN window purpose

**Verification:**

**After Authorization, Verify:**
1. Check Detail MC screen
2. Confirm program case shows ACTIVE
3. If shows SPEND DOWN, re-authorize and select ACTIVE
4. Document budget status in narrative

**When to Use SPEND DOWN:**

The SPEND DOWN option is used for:
- Standard Medically Needy cases
- Cases where individual has spenddown obligation
- NON-waiver MN cases

**For Waiver Cases:** Always use ACTIVE

**Troubleshooting:**

**If Budget Shows Spend Down Instead of Active:**

1. Re-authorize the budget
2. When SPEND DOWN window appears, select ACTIVE
3. Verify in Detail MC screen
4. If problem persists, contact N-FOCUS help desk

## Key Takeaways

✓ **MAGI and LTC Compatible:** MAGI eligible individuals CAN receive institutional care or waiver services; various eligibility factors apply depending on waiver type

✓ **Separate Spousal Budgets:** When both spouses receive institutional LOC, budget each separately in own master case with spouse listed "Out of Household"; each gets individual resource standard

✓ **Waiver Referral Timing:** Generally wait for Medicaid eligibility determination before referring for waiver; exceptions include deprivation cases and SIMP budgeting needs

✓ **Resource Denial Communication:** Do NOT send VR to advise client about spending down resources; instead, contact applicant directly to discuss resource limits and options

✓ **Facility Rate Contacts:** Contact business office, patient accounts, or billing specialist for per diem rates—NOT nursing staff; contact administrator if unsuccessful

✓ **Medication Coverage Complex:** Prescription coverage in facilities depends on Medicare Part D, patient agreement, and coverage periods; refer client questions to facility and pharmacy

✓ **Facility Transition Notices:** If benefit changes during facility transition, send notice to both facilities and participant; if no change in SOC, send only to new facility (MMIS shows only active status, not SOC amount)

✓ **Active vs. Spend Down:** For waiver budgets, select ACTIVE (not SPEND DOWN) when authorization window pops up; verify budget shows ACTIVE in Detail MC screen

✓ **Documentation Essential:** Document all facility contacts, rate verifications, client communications, and budget setup decisions in case narrative

✓ **Coordination Critical:** Maintain communication with E&E unit, facilities, and participants to ensure seamless service delivery and accurate billing
