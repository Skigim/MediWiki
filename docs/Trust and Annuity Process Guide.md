Trust and Annuity Guide
Purpose: To provide assistance with cases where a trust or annuity is involved, the following
guide has been created. The intent is to provide workers with tools and information to help up
front with the collection of information, to cut down on review time, and limit errors. The
following information outlines the types of trusts and annuities workers may run across and what
actions to take or verifications to request while working on cases that involve these financial tools.
When an individual applies for Medicaid, trusts and annuities must be reported. Through the
process below either the worker or central office staff will make a determination on whether the
trust is a countable or not-countable asset to the applicant. A determination will also need to be
made on if any monetary amount from an annuity payment or trust distribution or reimbursement
is countable income to the applicant when determining their Medicaid eligibility.
This process must be followed prior to sending the case to
DHHS.MedicaidPolicyQuestions@nebraska.gov for a determination. This will aid in a faster
review process from Medicaid Policy and will ensure a quicker turn around for workers to
determine Medicaid eligibility. In addition, the following information must be included in the
subject line of your email:
- Master Case Name and Number.
- If it is a Trust or Annuity.
o Include the type of trust if applicable; and - the word, verified (meaning all the
items listed have been obtained).
- Attach all Trust or Annuity documentation and any other supporting documentation to the
email for review.
- Workers must review Document Imaging (DI) and case narratives to determine if the Trust
or Annuity has already been reviewed and approved.
o If it has already been reviewed and approved and there have not been any changes
or amendments the Trust or Annuity does not need to be reviewed again.
o Workers must document this in the case narrative and proceed with the next steps
in processing the case. See the MLTC Change Management Guide and the MLTC
Processing Guide for additional information.
- Workers must review DI to determine if a copy of the complete Trust or Annuity is on file
already. There is no need to request this information from the individual if the complete
document is already on file.
NOTE:
- For current pay SSI individuals, a copy of the trust is NOT required.
- If real property is included in a trust, a copy of the recorded deed is required.
- No IM-1 can be signed on property that is included in a trust.
- Property included in a trust cannot appear on an IM-73.
While policy staff, along with legal services, review trusts and annuities, not all trusts and
annuities need central office review. Items listed below do not require central office review:

 Burial Trusts.

Trusts
Useful Terms for Reviewing Trusts:
Grantor: The grantor is the person who provides the assets which make up the trust. It is usually,
but not always, the same person who establishes the trust. The grantor is also sometimes called the
Trustor, Settlor, Trust maker, etc.
Trustee: The trustee is the person who holds title to and administers the trust. The trustee cannot
revoke a trust but is in charge of accepting and disbursing trust income and principal according to
the terms of the trust. The trustee is sometimes also the grantor. There may be more than one
trustee for a trust they would then be referenced as co-trustees.
Beneficiary: A beneficiary is a person who is entitled to receive either income or principal from a
trust. They may receive this currently, or the trust may be holding either income or principal for
their future benefit.
Sole Benefit: Trust distributions cannot be made for the benefit of other parties including a
spouse, children, parents, or others that are living in the beneficiary’s household.
Special Needs Trust:
A special needs trust contains the assets of a client and was established solely for the benefit of a
blind or disabled client. The trust must be established by the client's parent, grandparent, legal
guardian, or a court. It must also include a recapture clause, stating; the State will receive all
amounts remaining in the trust upon the death of the client or upon termination of the trust up to
the amount of total medical assistance paid on behalf of the client.
MLTC Policy Updated 6/2025

These trusts are generally established to protect important public benefits for the person with a
disability and thus must follow established criteria in order to be consistent with applicable federal
and state requirements. It is also important to note that laws and regulations change over time and
certain requirements, or criteria may change.
There are two types of Special Needs Trusts that can be established:
• First Party Trusts: also called Self-settled or Medicaid Payback trusts. These trusts are
irrevocable and funded with assets or resources belonging to an individual with a disability
such as from:
o A personal injury settlement.
o One or multiple inheritances that are directly for the disabled individual.
o Social Security retroactive or back-payments; or
o Conserved funds of the disabled individual.
• Third-Party Trusts: are funded with assets from a person other than the disabled
individual. (Ex: a parent of the disabled individual can use their own resources to establish
a Third-Party Trust).
NOTE: Third-Party Trusts do not have a Medicaid Recapture Clause. Instead, the remaining
assets in the trust are distributed to named beneficiaries in the trust.
Workers must ensure the following steps are completed before submitting the trust and
supporting documentation (if applicable) via email to central office for review:
 A complete copy of the trust including all amendments and attachments must be attached
to the email sent for review.
 A copy of the most recent financial statement or current accounting record must be
attached to the email sent for review.
o More than just the current balance is needed, verification must include information
on dispersals as well.
 Review the document and verify that it states this is a Special Needs Trust.
o Some may be titled Supplemental Needs Trusts or Irrevocable Trust for the
Special Needs.
o Titles and language used throughout the document may vary. Workers cannot rely
on them solely.
 Recorded deeds are not required unless the property is a countable resource, or the
property is owned by a trust.
 Confirm the identity of the guardian of the client, when necessary; and
 Confirm the Trust is funded with the client’s assets.
O Additional documentation may be needed to identify this.
Once all the items above have been obtained attach all relevant documents and send an email to
DHHS.MedicaidPolicyQuestions@nebraska.gov requesting a determination of the treatment of
the trust for budgeting purposes.

Pooled Trust:
A pooled trust is a trust containing the assets of a disabled individual, or individuals that is
established and managed by a nonprofit association in a separate account solely for the benefit of
a disabled individual.
Per 477 NAC 23-003.05(A)(vi)(2)(g)(iv)(1)(b), a pooled trust:
• Contains the assets of the client.
• Is established and managed by a non-profit association.
• A separate account is maintained for each beneficiary of the trust, but, for purposes of
investment and management of assets, the trust pools these accounts.
• Accounts in the trust are established solely for the benefit of individuals who are blind or
disabled (receiving or eligible to receive SSI, RSDI, or AABD/MA); and
• The trust provides that to the extent any amounts remaining in the beneficiary’s account
upon his/her death are not retained by the trust, the trust shall pay to the State of
Nebraska the amount remaining up to the amount of total Medicaid paid on behalf of the
client (recapture clause).
Workers must ensure the following steps are completed before submitting the trust and
supporting documentation (if applicable) via email to central office for review:
 Review the document and verify that it states this is a Pooled Trust.
o This will be contained in the main body of the first paragraph.
 A complete copy of the Joinder Agreement must be attached to the email sent for review.
 A copy of the most recent financial statement or current accounting record must be
attached to the email sent for review.
o More than just the current balance is needed, verification must include information
on dispersals as well.
 Recorded deeds are not required unless the property is a countable resource, or the
property is owned by a trust; and
 Confirm the Trust is funded with the client’s assets.
o Additional documentation may be needed to identify this.
Once all of the items have been obtained attach all relevant documents and send an email to
DHHS.MedicaidPolicyQuestions@nebraska.gov requesting a determination of the treatment of
the trust for budgeting purposes.

Revocable Trust:
A revocable trust may be altered or terminated during the grantor's lifetime. Since the trust may be
altered at any time until the grantor's death, it is considered part of the grantor's estate and is
subject to taxation. The property is passed on to the beneficiaries only after the grantor's death,
and the revocable trust then becomes irrevocable. Revocable trusts may be considered an
available resource. See 477 NAC 23-003.05(A)(vi)(2)(f).

 If real property is included in the trust the deed(s) to the property is required.
NOTE: any asset that is held by a revocable trust does not have the same
exclusions that a client owned asset does (Ex: a house is not an exempt resource if
it is owned by a trust).
 Recorded deeds are not required unless the property is a countable resource, or the
property is owned by a trust; and
 The Grantor / Trustee relationship must be documented in the trust.
NOTE: if the applicant or their spouse is a Grantor, the trust is a countable
resource.
Once all of the items have been obtained the worker must review the information and make a
determination on the trust. Workers must document this in the case narrative and proceed with the
next steps in processing the case. See the MLTC Change Management Guide and the MLTC
Processing Guide for additional information.

Irrevocable Trust:
An irrevocable trust is a trust that cannot be modified or terminated without the permission of the
beneficiary. The grantor, having transferred assets into the trust, effectively removes all of his or
her rights of ownership to the assets and the trust. See 477 NAC 23-003.05(A)(vi)(2)(g).
Workers must ensure the following steps are completed before submitting the trust and
supporting documentation (if applicable) via email to central office for review:
 A complete copy of the trust, including all amendments and attachments must be attached
to the email sent for review.
 A copy of the legal documents establishing the trust must be attached to the email sent for
review.
 Review the document and verify that it states this is an Irrevocable Trust.

Testamentary Trust:
A testamentary trust is a legal arrangement created as specified in a person's will and is
occasioned by the death of that person. A testamentary trust can be created to oversee such assets.
A trustee is appointed to direct the trust until a set time when the trust expires, such as when
minor beneficiaries reach a specified age or accomplish a deed such as completing a set
educational goal or achieving a specified matrimonial status. See 477 NAC 23-
003.05(A)(vi)(2)(g)(vi).
NOTE: Due to how this trust is established there may not be a separate trust document that is
created; the information needed by the worker may be found in the deceased person’s will. Due to
this only a copy of the will is needed in certain cases.
Workers must ensure the following steps are completed before submitting the trust and
supporting documentation (if applicable) via email to central office for review:
 A complete copy of the Will and Trust, including all amendments and attachments
must be attached to the email sent for review; and

Annuities
An annuity is a right to receive periodic payment, either for life or a term of years. An immediate
annuity is usually purchased with assets. See 477 NAC 20.003.04.
Workers must ensure the following steps are completed before submitting the trust and
supporting documentation (if applicable) via email to central office for review:
 Confirm if the annuity is a pension annuity. If yes, an annuity verification form is not
needed.
o If unsure of the annuity type this form can be used to obtain the information, but again
is not a requirement if the annuity is indeed a pension annuity.
o Additionally, a pension annuity does not need to be sent in for review to central office
staff.
 A complete Annuity Verification form is required for all immediate annuities and must be
attached to the email sent for review.
o However, these are not needed on “pension” annuities.
 A complete copy of the annuity contract must be obtained and
must be attached to the email sent for review; and
o This includes the issuance letter and application form.
 Review for the issue date, this is needed to determine if any promissory notes were
backed dated.
Once all of the items have been obtained attach all relevant documents and send an email to
DHHS.MedicaidPolicyQuestions@nebraska.gov requesting a determination of the treatment of
the trust for budgeting purposes.
**All immediate annuities (Ex: ELCO annuities) must be submitted to central office for review.

Trust Distribution Chart
The following chart provides general guidelines for countable and not-countable
trust distribution and reimbursements. Anything under the countable list would be
considered income to the client because it is not an allowable distribution from the
trust. Anything under the not-countable list is not considered income to the client
because it is an allowable distribution from the trust. This is not a comprehensive
list and is not a guarantee that DHHS will allow the trust distribution or
reimbursement.
