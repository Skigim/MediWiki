# Trust and Annuity Process Guide
*Comprehensive Review and Determination Procedures for Trusts and Annuities in Medicaid Eligibility*

---

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive assistance for staff working cases where a trust or annuity is involved. The guide consolidates information about various types of trusts and annuities that workers may encounter and provides clear direction on required actions, verification requests, and central office review procedures. The intent is to provide workers with tools and information to help up-front with the collection of information, to cut down on review time, and limit errors.

When an individual applies for Medicaid, trusts and annuities must be reported. Through the process outlined in this guide, either the worker or central office staff will make a determination on whether the trust is a countable or non-countable asset to the applicant. A determination will also need to be made on whether any monetary amount from an annuity payment or trust distribution or reimbursement is countable income to the applicant when determining their Medicaid eligibility.

This process must be followed prior to sending cases to central office for determination. Following these procedures will aid in a faster review process from Medicaid Policy and will ensure a quicker turnaround for workers to determine Medicaid eligibility.

## Key Definitions

**Annuity** – A financial product providing a right to receive periodic payments, either for life or a term of years. An immediate annuity is usually purchased with assets and begins making payments shortly after purchase.

**Beneficiary** – A person who is entitled to receive either income or principal from a trust. They may receive this currently, or the trust may be holding either income or principal for their future benefit.

**Co-Trustees** – Multiple individuals designated to jointly hold title to and administer a trust. When there is more than one trustee for a trust, they are referenced as co-trustees.

**Document Imaging (DI)** – The system in NFOCUS where scanned documents and verification materials are stored and can be accessed by eligibility workers.

**First Party Trust (Self-Settled Trust or Medicaid Payback Trust)** – A special needs trust that is irrevocable and funded with assets or resources belonging to an individual with a disability, such as from a personal injury settlement, inheritance, Social Security back-payments, or conserved funds.

**Grantor (also Trustor, Settlor, Trust Maker)** – The person who provides the assets which make up the trust. It is usually, but not always, the same person who establishes the trust. The grantor may also serve as the trustee.

**Immediate Annuity** – An annuity that begins making periodic payments shortly after purchase, typically purchased with a lump sum of assets.

**Irrevocable Trust** – A trust that cannot be modified or terminated without the permission of the beneficiary. The grantor, having transferred assets into the trust, effectively removes all rights of ownership to the assets and the trust.

**Joinder Agreement** – The agreement document used to join an individual's assets into a pooled trust managed by a nonprofit association.

**Pension Annuity** – An annuity received as part of employment retirement benefits. Pension annuities do not require an annuity verification form or central office review.

**Pooled Trust** – A trust containing the assets of disabled individuals that is established and managed by a nonprofit association, with separate accounts for each beneficiary that are pooled for investment purposes.

**Promissory Note** – A financial instrument containing a written promise by one party to pay another party a definite sum of money, either on demand or at a specified future date.

**Recapture Clause (Medicaid Payback Provision)** – A provision in certain trusts stating that the State will receive all amounts remaining in the trust upon the death of the beneficiary or upon termination of the trust, up to the amount of total medical assistance paid on behalf of the beneficiary.

**Revocable Trust** – A trust that may be altered or terminated during the grantor's lifetime. Since the trust may be altered at any time until the grantor's death, it is considered part of the grantor's estate.

**Sole Benefit** – A requirement that trust distributions be made only for the benefit of the named beneficiary and cannot be made for the benefit of other parties including a spouse, children, parents, or others living in the beneficiary's household.

**Special Needs Trust** – A trust containing the assets of a disabled individual and established solely for the benefit of a blind or disabled individual. Must be established by the individual's parent, grandparent, legal guardian, or a court, and must include a recapture clause.

**Supplemental Needs Trust** – Another term often used for Special Needs Trusts, providing supplemental benefits beyond what public programs provide.

**Testamentary Trust** – A legal arrangement created as specified in a person's will and occasioned by the death of that person. The trust is created to oversee assets until a set time when the trust expires.

**Third-Party Trust** – A special needs trust funded with assets from a person other than the disabled individual (e.g., a parent using their own resources to establish a trust for their disabled child). These trusts do not have a Medicaid recapture clause.

**Trustee** – The person who holds title to and administers the trust. The trustee cannot revoke a trust but is in charge of accepting and disbursing trust income and principal according to the terms of the trust. The trustee is sometimes also the grantor.

## Trust Types and Requirements

### Special Needs Trust

#### Overview

A special needs trust contains the assets of a client and was established solely for the benefit of a blind or disabled client. The trust must be established by the client's parent, grandparent, legal guardian, or a court. It must also include a recapture clause, stating: **the State will receive all amounts remaining in the trust upon the death of the client or upon termination of the trust up to the amount of total medical assistance paid on behalf of the client.**

These trusts are generally established to protect important public benefits for the person with a disability and thus must follow established criteria in order to be consistent with applicable federal and state requirements. It is also important to note that laws and regulations change over time and certain requirements or criteria may change.

#### Types of Special Needs Trusts

**First Party Trusts (Self-Settled or Medicaid Payback Trusts):**

These trusts are irrevocable and funded with assets or resources belonging to an individual with a disability such as from:

- A personal injury settlement
- One or multiple inheritances that are directly for the disabled individual
- Social Security retroactive or back-payments
- Conserved funds of the disabled individual

**Third-Party Trusts:**

These trusts are funded with assets from a person other than the disabled individual (e.g., a parent of the disabled individual can use their own resources to establish a Third-Party Trust).

> **Note:** Third-Party Trusts do **NOT** have a Medicaid Recapture Clause. Instead, the remaining assets in the trust are distributed to named beneficiaries in the trust.

#### Required Verification Checklist

Workers must ensure the following steps are completed **before submitting** the trust and supporting documentation (if applicable) via email to central office for review:

**☐** A complete copy of the trust including all amendments and attachments must be attached to the email sent for review

**☐** A copy of the most recent financial statement or current accounting record must be attached to the email sent for review
- More than just the current balance is needed
- Verification must include information on dispersals as well

**☐** Review the document and verify that it states this is a Special Needs Trust
- Some may be titled "Supplemental Needs Trusts" or "Irrevocable Trust for the Special Needs"
- Titles and language used throughout the document may vary
- Workers cannot rely on them solely

**☐** Recorded deeds are not required unless the property is a countable resource, or the property is owned by a trust

**☐** Confirm the identity of the guardian of the client, when necessary

**☐** Confirm the Trust is funded with the client's assets
- Additional documentation may be needed to identify this

#### Submission for Review

Once all the items above have been obtained, attach all relevant documents and send an email to **DHHS.MedicaidPolicyQuestions@nebraska.gov** requesting a determination of the treatment of the trust for budgeting purposes.

### Revocable Trust

#### Overview

A revocable trust may be altered or terminated during the grantor's lifetime. Since the trust may be altered at any time until the grantor's death, it is considered part of the grantor's estate and is subject to taxation. The property is passed on to the beneficiaries only after the grantor's death, and the revocable trust then becomes irrevocable. Revocable trusts may be considered an available resource.

**Regulatory Reference:** See 477 NAC 23-003.05(A)(vi)(2)(f)

#### Required Verification Checklist

Workers must ensure the following steps are completed **before reviewing** the trust:

**☐** A complete copy of the trust, including all amendments and attachments must be attached to the email sent for review

**☐** A copy of the legal documents establishing the trust must be attached to the email sent for review

**☐** Confirm the identity of the person or persons who is/are funding the trust

**☐** A copy of the most recent financial statement or current accounting record
- More than just the current balance is needed
- Verification must include information on dispersals as well

**☐** Review the document and verify that it states this is a Revocable Trust
- Titles and language used throughout the document may vary
- Workers cannot rely on them solely

**☐** Review to determine what was deposited into the trust

**☐** If real property is included in the trust, the deed(s) to the property is required
- **Note:** Any asset that is held by a revocable trust does NOT have the same exclusions that a client-owned asset does (e.g., a house is not an exempt resource if it is owned by a trust)

**☐** Recorded deeds are not required unless the property is a countable resource, or the property is owned by a trust

**☐** The Grantor/Trustee relationship must be documented in the trust
- **Note:** If the applicant or their spouse is a Grantor, the trust is a countable resource

#### Worker Determination

Once all of the items have been obtained, the worker must review the information and **make a determination on the trust**. 

**Workers must:**
- Document this in the case narrative
- Proceed with the next steps in processing the case
- See the MLTC Change Management Guide and the MLTC Processing Guide for additional information

> **Note:** Revocable trusts do NOT require central office review unless the worker needs assistance with the determination.

### Irrevocable Trust

#### Overview

### Testamentary Trust

#### Overview

A testamentary trust is a legal arrangement created as specified in a person's will and is occasioned by the death of that person. A testamentary trust can be created to oversee such assets. A trustee is appointed to direct the trust until a set time when the trust expires, such as when minor beneficiaries reach a specified age or accomplish a deed such as completing a set educational goal or achieving a specified matrimonial status.

**Regulatory Reference:** See 477 NAC 23-003.05(A)(vi)(2)(g)(vi)

> **Note:** Due to how this trust is established there may not be a separate trust document that is created; the information needed by the worker may be found in the deceased person's will. Due to this, only a copy of the will is needed in certain cases.

#### Required Verification Checklist

Workers must ensure the following steps are completed **before submitting** the trust and supporting documentation (if applicable) via email to central office for review:

**☐** A complete copy of the Will and Trust, including all amendments and attachments must be attached to the email sent for review

## Annuities

### Overview

An annuity is a right to receive periodic payment, either for life or a term of years. An immediate annuity is usually purchased with assets.

**Regulatory Reference:** See 477 NAC 20.003.04

### Required Verification Checklist

Workers must ensure the following steps are completed **before submitting** the annuity and supporting documentation (if applicable) via email to central office for review:

## Trust Distribution Chart

### Overview

The following chart provides **general guidelines** for countable and not-countable trust distribution and reimbursements. 

**Countable distributions** would be considered income to the client because they are not allowable distributions from the trust.

**Not-countable distributions** are not considered income to the client because they are allowable distributions from the trust.

> **Important:** This is NOT a comprehensive list and is NOT a guarantee that DHHS will allow the trust distribution or reimbursement.

### Countable Trust Distributions

The following distributions are generally **COUNTABLE as income:**

- **Rent or mortgage payments**
- **Groceries, food items, or dining out**
- **Basic utilities** (heating, cooling, water, garbage—not phone, cable, or internet)
- **Room and board or base rate** for a residential facility
- **Cash or payment to the beneficiary**
- **Charitable donations or gifts to others** (may not be countable, but may be a deprivation)
- **Anything covered by another funding source** (Medicaid, Medicare, SNAP, etc.)

### Not-Countable Trust Distributions

The following distributions are generally **NOT countable as income:**

- **Clothing**
- **Purchase or maintenance of a pet**
- **Phone, cable, or internet**
- **Transportation expenses and community outings** (for the individual and required companion only)
- **Necessary supplemental or support service costs** not paid by Medicaid or Medicare (co-pays, chore services, etc.)
- **Furniture or household items**
- **Basic household items** such as cleaning supplies and toothpaste
- **Necessary home modifications** for accessibility or equipment for home care
- **Communication or other assistive devices** not covered by Medicaid
- **Expenses to visit family for vacations** (for the individual and required companion only)
- **Education expenses** for the individual
- **Interests or hobbies** for the individual
- **Pre-paid funeral or burial plan items** that are within state Medicaid and SSA requirements (must be non-refundable, non-transferable and cannot be converted to cash)

### Additional Information on Deprivation

For additional information on deprivation, see the **Deprivation of Resources Process Guide**.

## Key Takeaways

✓ **Review DI before requesting documents** – Always check Document Imaging and case narratives to determine if trusts or annuities have already been reviewed and approved before requesting new documentation.

✓ **Subject line must include verification status** – Email subject lines to central office must include Master Case name/number, trust or annuity type, and the word "verified" to confirm all required documentation is attached.

✓ **SSI recipients do not need trust copies** – For current pay SSI individuals, a copy of the trust is not required.

✓ **Real property in trusts requires recorded deeds** – If real property is included in a trust, a copy of the recorded deed is required; no IM-1 can be signed on trust-owned property.

✓ **Revocable trusts do not require central office review** – Workers can review revocable trusts independently and make determinations following regulatory guidance; document in case narrative.

✓ **Pension annuities do not need verification forms or central office review** – TIAA CREF, Civil Service, and Military annuities/pensions only require monthly amount determination for budgeting.

✓ **All immediate annuities must be submitted for review** – ELCO annuities and other immediate annuities must be sent to central office for determination.

✓ **Financial statements must show disbursals, not just balances** – When submitting trust or annuity financial documentation, more than just the current balance is needed; verification must include information on dispersals.

✓ **Third-Party Special Needs Trusts do not have recapture clauses** – Unlike First Party trusts, Third-Party Special Needs Trusts distribute remaining assets to named beneficiaries rather than paying back Medicaid.

✓ **Pooled trusts require Joinder Agreements** – Complete copy of the Joinder Agreement must be obtained and submitted with pooled trust documentation.

✓ **Testamentary trusts may be in the will** – Due to how testamentary trusts are established, the information may be found in the deceased person's will rather than a separate trust document.

✓ **Trust distribution guidelines are not guarantees** – The Trust Distribution Chart provides general guidelines, but is not comprehensive and does not guarantee DHHS will allow specific distributions.

✓ **Grantor status determines revocable trust countability** – If the applicant or their spouse is a Grantor of a revocable trust, the trust is a countable resource.

✓ **Trust amendments require new review** – If an amendment has been made to the trust or the trust appears to be terminating, obtain all information and submit for new central office determination.

✓ **Basic utilities in trust distributions are countable** – Distributions for heating, cooling, water, and garbage are countable as income, but phone, cable, and internet are not countable.
