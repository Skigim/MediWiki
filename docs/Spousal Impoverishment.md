# Spousal Impoverishment

**Spousal Impoverishment (SIMP) Budgeting & Procedures**  
*Comprehensive guide to protecting community spouse resources and income when one spouse requires institutional care*

---

## Overview

**Spousal Impoverishment (SIMP)** budgeting is a process that allows the state to protect a **community spouse** and **dependent family members** from an institutionalized spouse's requirement to spend down their share of resources prior to receiving Medicaid.

**Purpose**: SIMP budgeting is completed to assist a married couple in protecting a standard of living for the spouse who is **NOT** receiving long-term care (LTC) services. The purpose of SIMP is to ensure an individual residing in an LTC facility, such as a nursing facility or through a waiver, is able to gain access to Medicaid services, while their spouse is able to have a means to support themselves.

**Key Forms**: The process utilizes two critical forms:
- **IM-73 (Assessment of Resources)**: Used to assess total countable resources of married couple and determine reserved amount for community spouse
- **IM-74 (Designation of Resources)**: Used to document how resources will be divided between spouses

**Institutional Level of Care (LOC)**: Required for any individual seeking Medicaid-funded long-term care services. An individual must meet the criteria outlined in 477 NAC 26 002.05.

**Important Notes**:
- SIMP budgeting is **separate and distinct** from other Medicaid budgeting processes
- Detailed SIMP procedures can be found in [MLTC Processing Guide](MLTC%20Processing%20Guide.md)
- Additional renewal procedures can be found in [Non-MAGI & Combined Renewal Process Guide](Non-MAGI%20%26%20Combined%20Renewal%20Process%20Guide.md)

## Key Definitions

**Facility Spouse (LTC Spouse or SIMP Spouse)**: The spouse who resides in an institutional setting, such as a nursing facility, ICF-DD, or on a waiver.

**Community Spouse**: The spouse who is legally married to the facility spouse but is NOT residing in an LTC facility.

**Assessment Month**: The month and year in which either spouse first received or required an institutional level of care (LOC) for at least **30 consecutive days** while married.

**Reserved Amount**: The amount of resources that the community spouse is allowed to retain, calculated from the total countable resources in the assessment month. The reserved amount is subject to a yearly minimum and maximum (477-000-029).

**Institutional Level of Care (LOC)**: Medical necessity criteria that must be met for waiver services or nursing facility care, as outlined in 477 NAC 26 002.05 and 477-000-042.

**Dependent Family Member**: A minor child, dependent parent, dependent brother or sister, or dependent son or daughter of either spouse who resides with the community spouse.

**Community Spouse Maintenance Allowance**: The amount of the facility spouse's income that is allocated to the community spouse to bring their income up to the maintenance needs allowance (at minimum 150% of Federal Poverty Level for household of two).

**IM-73 (Assessment of Resources)**: Form used to assess total countable resources of a married couple as of the first moment of the first day of the month of the continuous period of institutionalization. **One assessment per lifetime per married couple.**

**IM-74 (Designation of Resources)**: Form used to document how resources will be divided between the facility spouse and community spouse. Must be signed before SIMP case can be processed.

**Assessment Request**: Request made by either spouse, or their authorized representative, to have an assessment of resources completed. Must be requested when facility spouse has been at LOC for at least **30 consecutive days** while married.

**Interspousal Transfer**: Transfer of resources between spouses after the assessment month. Must be completed by the first Medicaid renewal to avoid deprivation sanctions.

---

## Assessment Request

### When Assessment Can Be Requested

An assessment of resources can be requested when the facility spouse has been at an **institutional level of care (LOC) for at least 30 consecutive days** while married (477 NAC 26 003.01(B)).

**30-Day LOC Criteria**:
- Individual must meet institutional level of care criteria for **at least 30 consecutive days**
- Can be met through any combination of:
  - Hospital stay
  - Nursing facility stay
  - ICF-DD stay
  - HCBS waiver services
  - PACE (Program of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly)

**Important**: The 30 consecutive days of LOC do **NOT** need to be in same facility or even same type of facility.

### One Assessment Per Lifetime Per Married Couple

**Critical Rule**: Only **one (1) assessment per lifetime per married couple** (477 NAC 26 003.01(B)).

**What This Means**:
- If couple has previously had an assessment completed while married to each other, **no new assessment** can be completed
- This applies even if:
  - They divorced and remarried
  - Previous assessment was years ago
  - Circumstances have changed significantly

**Exception**: If either spouse remarries a **different person**, new assessment can be completed with new spouse.

### Who Can Request Assessment

Assessment can be requested by:
- **Facility spouse**
- **Community spouse**
- **Authorized representative** of either spouse

### Assessment Month Determination

**Assessment Month**: The month and year in which either spouse **first received or required** an institutional level of care for at least 30 consecutive days while married.

**Key Point**: Assessment month is determined by the **first moment of the first day** of the month of the continuous period of institutionalization.

**Example**: If John Smith entered nursing facility on January 15, 2023, and remained at LOC for 30+ consecutive days, the assessment month would be **January 2023**.

### E&E Referral for Assessment

When a request for an assessment is received, a referral must be sent to **Eligibility & Enrollment (E&E)** staff to complete the assessment.

**E&E Responsibilities**:
- Gather financial information from both spouses
- Complete IM-73 (Assessment of Resources)
- Calculate reserved amount
- Provide information to worker for case processing

**Worker Responsibilities After E&E Completes Assessment**:
- Review IM-73 for accuracy
- Assist couple in completing IM-74 (Designation of Resources)
- Process SIMP case in NFOCUS

## Assessment of Resources (IM-73)

### Purpose of IM-73

The **IM-73 (Assessment of Resources)** is used to assess the total countable resources of a married couple as of the **first moment of the first day of the assessment month**.

**Key Functions**:
1. Documents all countable resources owned by either or both spouses
2. Calculates total countable resources
3. Determines the **reserved amount** for the community spouse
4. Provides basis for completing IM-74 (Designation of Resources)

### Accessing IM-73

**Location**: The IM-73 is available on the **Medicaid Case Page** in NFOCUS.

**Navigation**:
1. Go to Medicaid program case
2. Select **Forms** option
3. Choose **IM-73 Assessment of Resources**
4. System will populate certain fields from case information

### Reserved Amount Calculation

**Formula**: The reserved amount is calculated as **one-half (1/2) of the couple's total countable resources** as of the assessment month.

**Minimum and Maximum Amounts**: The reserved amount is subject to a yearly minimum and maximum established in **477-000-029**.

**Example Calculation**:
- Total countable resources in assessment month: **$150,000**
- One-half of total: **$75,000**
- If $75,000 falls within the minimum/maximum range for that year, the reserved amount would be **$75,000**

**Access to Historical Minimums/Maximums**: See **477-000-029** for complete list of yearly minimums and maximums.

### No Amendments After Signatures

**Critical Rule**: Once the IM-73 has been **signed by both spouses** (or their authorized representatives), **no amendments can be made** to add or remove resources.

**Why This Matters**:
- Signatures indicate both spouses agree to the documented resources
- Assessment is a snapshot in time (assessment month)
- Any resources discovered later are handled through other processes (not by amending IM-73)

**What If Resources Are Discovered Later?**:
- Resources owned in assessment month but **not listed on IM-73**: See "Changes During SIMP" section
- Resources acquired **after assessment month**: Counted as resources of the spouse who acquired them

### Information Gathering for IM-73

**Required Information**:
1. **All bank accounts** (checking, savings, money market, etc.)
2. **Investment accounts** (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, CDs, IRAs, 401(k)s, etc.)
3. **Real property** (land, buildings, homes other than primary residence)
4. **Vehicles** (if countable)
5. **Life insurance** with cash value
6. **Business interests**
7. **Trust assets** (if countable)
8. **Any other countable resources**

**Verification Requirements**: All resources must be **verified** with documentation showing:
- Ownership (whose name is on account/title)
- Value as of assessment month
- Type of ownership (sole, joint, POD, etc.)

**Leading Questions**: E&E staff should ask **leading questions** to ensure all resources are disclosed:
- "Do you have any bank accounts?"
- "Do you own any property other than your home?"
- "Do you have any retirement accounts or investments?"
- "Do you have any vehicles?"
- "Do you have life insurance policies with cash value?"
- "Are you a beneficiary of any trusts?"

## Designation of Resources (IM-74)

### Purpose of IM-74

The **IM-74 (Designation of Resources)** is used to document **how resources will be divided** between the facility spouse and the community spouse.

**Key Functions**:
1. Documents which resources will be retained by community spouse (up to reserved amount)
2. Documents which resources will be counted for facility spouse
3. Creates plan for any interspousal transfers needed
4. Must be signed before SIMP case can be processed

### When IM-74 Must Be Completed

**Timing**: IM-74 must be completed when the **total countable resources** of both spouses are equal to or less than:
- **Reserved amount + $4,000**

**Formula**: Reserved Amount + $4,000 = Maximum resources to complete IM-74

**Example**:
- Reserved amount: **$75,000**
- Maximum resources: **$75,000 + $4,000 = $79,000**
- If couple's total resources are **$79,000 or less**, IM-74 can be completed
- If couple's total resources are **more than $79,000**, resources must be spent down first

### Must Be Signed Before SIMP Processing

**Critical Rule**: The IM-74 **must be signed** by both spouses (or authorized representatives) **before** the SIMP case can be processed in NFOCUS.

**Why This Matters**:
- IM-74 documents the couple's agreement on resource division
- NFOCUS budgets are based on resource ownership as documented on IM-74
- Without signed IM-74, worker cannot accurately enter resources in NFOCUS

### Trust Assets Excluded from IM-74

**Rule**: Resources held in **irrevocable trusts** are **NOT** included on the IM-74 for designation purposes.

**Why?**:
- Irrevocable trust assets cannot be transferred or designated
- Trust terms control how assets are used
- Trust assets are handled separately (may be counted as resources based on trust terms, but designation is controlled by trust document)

**Action**: Document trust assets separately; do not include on IM-74 resource designation list.

### Verification Procedures for IM-74

**All resources listed on IM-74 must be verified** with current documentation showing:
1. **Current ownership** (whose name is on account/title now)
2. **Current value** (dollar amount as of date of designation)
3. **Type of ownership** (sole, joint, POD, etc.)

**Why Verify Again?**
- Time may have passed since IM-73 was completed
- Values may have changed
- Ownership may have changed
- New accounts may have been opened

**Verification Sources**: Same as IM-73 (AVS, bank statements, property records, etc.)

### Drafting the IM-74

**Process**:
1. List all current countable resources with current values
2. Designate which resources will be retained by community spouse (up to reserved amount)
3. Designate remaining resources to facility spouse
4. Document any interspousal transfers needed to achieve designation
5. Calculate totals for each spouse

**Community Spouse Resources**:
- Total value cannot exceed reserved amount
- Select specific accounts/assets to designate to community spouse
- Consider liquidity and accessibility when selecting

**Facility Spouse Resources**:
- All resources not designated to community spouse
- Will be counted toward facility spouse's $4,000 resource limit

### Ownership Transfers

**If resources need to be transferred** between spouses to match the IM-74 designation:
- Document transfer plan on IM-74
- Transfers must be completed by **first Medicaid renewal**
- Failure to complete transfers may result in deprivation sanction

**Example**: If joint bank account with $50,000 is designated to community spouse, account must be changed to community spouse's sole ownership.

### Over Reserved Amount Procedures

**If community spouse resources exceed reserved amount** after designation:
- Excess amount is countable resource for facility spouse
- Must be spent down to $4,000 for facility spouse to be eligible

**If resources are transferred to community spouse above reserved amount**:
- May be considered deprivation of resources
- See [Deprivation of Resources Process Guide](Deprivation%20of%20Resources%20Process%20Guide.md)

## Dependent Family Members

### Who Qualifies as Dependent Family Member

**Dependent Family Member**: A person who qualifies as a dependent under federal income tax rules **AND** who resides with the community spouse.

**Categories**:
1. **Minor children** (under age 18 or under 19 if full-time student)
2. **Dependent parent** of either spouse
3. **Dependent brother or sister** of either spouse
4. **Dependent son or daughter** (adult child who is disabled)

**Residency Requirement**: Dependent must **reside with community spouse** to be included in SIMP budgeting.

### Impact on Income Standard

**Income Allocation**: The presence of dependent family members **increases** the community spouse maintenance allowance (income standard).

**Dependent Relative Allocation**: Additional income can be allocated to bring dependent family member's income up to a specified level.

**NFOCUS Entry**: Dependent family members are entered in the **Other Role** section of the community spouse's budget.

## Interspousal Transfers

### Verification by First Renewal

**Critical Rule**: Interspousal transfers documented on IM-74 **must be verified as completed** by the **first Medicaid renewal**.

**What This Means**:
- If IM-74 shows resources need to be transferred from one spouse to another, transfers must be completed within first 12 months of Medicaid eligibility
- Verification of completed transfers must be provided by first renewal

**Consequences of Not Completing Transfers**:
- May be considered deprivation of resources
- May result in penalty period
- May affect continuing eligibility

### Circumstances Preventing Transfers

**Valid Reasons** that may prevent interspousal transfers from being completed:
1. **Financial institution policies** (e.g., joint account holder must appear in person to remove name)
2. **Legal restrictions** (e.g., conservatorship or guardianship prevents transfers)
3. **Health issues** (e.g., community spouse is hospitalized and unable to complete paperwork)
4. **Property issues** (e.g., mortgage company will not allow name removal)

**Action if Transfer Cannot Be Completed**:
- Document reason in case narrative
- Request verification of circumstances preventing transfer
- Consult with supervisor or policy staff
- May need legal review

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Joint Checking Account**
- **IM-74 Designation**: Community spouse to retain joint checking account ($30,000)
- **Transfer Required**: Remove facility spouse's name from account OR transfer funds to new account in community spouse's sole name
- **Deadline**: By first renewal
- **Verification**: Bank statement or letter showing account is now in community spouse's sole name

**Scenario 2: Jointly Owned Property**
- **IM-74 Designation**: Community spouse to retain lake cabin ($50,000 equity)
- **Transfer Required**: Deed must be changed to show community spouse as sole owner
- **Deadline**: By first renewal
- **Verification**: Recorded deed showing community spouse as sole owner

**Scenario 3: Unable to Complete Transfer**
- **IM-74 Designation**: Community spouse to retain savings account ($25,000)
- **Issue**: Bank requires both spouses to appear in person; facility spouse is in nursing home and unable to travel
- **Action**: Document situation; request letter from bank explaining policy; consult with supervisor
- **Possible Resolution**: May need to close account and open new account in community spouse's sole name (if facility spouse has POA for community spouse or vice versa)

---

## Renewals in SIMP

### First Renewal vs. Subsequent Renewals

**First Renewal** (approximately 12 months after initial approval):
- More intensive review required
- Must verify interspousal transfers were completed
- Review for any unreported resources or income
- Verify community spouse resources still within reserved amount

**Subsequent Renewals** (after first renewal):
- Standard renewal procedures
- Verify facility spouse resources ≤ $4,000
- Verify community spouse resources ≤ reserved amount
- Review income and expenses

### Verification Requirements at First Renewal

**Must Verify**:
1. **Interspousal transfers completed** as documented on IM-74
2. **Current value of all resources** for both spouses
3. **Community spouse resources** ≤ reserved amount
4. **Facility spouse resources** ≤ $4,000
5. **Income** for both spouses (current amounts)
6. **Expenses** for community spouse (housing, medical, etc.)

**If Interspousal Transfers Not Completed**:
- Document reason
- Determine if valid reason exists
- Consult with supervisor
- May need to review for deprivation

### Deprivation Rules for Community Spouse Transfers

**General Rule**: Transfers between spouses **after the assessment month** are **exempt from deprivation** as long as community spouse's resources do not exceed the reserved amount.

**Exception**: If community spouse receives resources that cause their total resources to **exceed the reserved amount**, the excess may be considered deprivation.

**Example**:
- Reserved amount: $75,000
- Community spouse currently has: $70,000
- Facility spouse transfers additional $10,000 to community spouse
- Community spouse now has: $80,000
- Excess over reserved amount: $5,000
- The $5,000 may be considered deprivation

**Action**: Review with supervisor and/or policy staff if community spouse resources exceed reserved amount.

## Changes During SIMP

### Resource Changes

**Resources Cannot Be Added to IM-73 After Completion**:
- If resources owned in assessment month are discovered **after IM-73 is signed**, they **cannot be added** to IM-73
- Instead, resources are handled as follows:
  - If currently still owned: Count as current resources
  - If sold/transferred: Review for deprivation

**Example**: IM-73 completed in January 2023. In June 2024, worker discovers couple owned $10,000 CD in January 2023 that was not listed on IM-73.
- **Cannot** amend IM-73 to add CD
- **Must** determine current status of CD:
  - If still owned: Count as current resource
  - If cashed out: Determine where funds went; review for deprivation if transferred

### Acquired Resources (After Assessment Month)

**Resources Acquired After Assessment Month**:
- Counted as resources of the spouse who acquired them
- **Not** added to IM-73
